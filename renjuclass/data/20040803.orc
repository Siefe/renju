<14:26:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after 27

<14:27:51>[TALK]{Fermat}y

<14:42:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what was its idea ?
<14:42:51>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EE
<14:43:18>[TALK]{sunrain}good connection for next move?
<14:43:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}OK, I'll tell you
<14:43:35>[TALK]{wolfzhou}fill the board?
<14:43:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}40-c7 woudln't be good
<14:43:46>[TALK]{SamSite}c7 is then more stronger even
<14:44:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because black would defend
<14:44:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}simply
<14:44:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I would waste my material
<14:44:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and the position would be way easier for black to defend
<14:44:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and there is nothing confusing about that move
<14:44:35>[TALK]{shuker}then what about L8
<14:44:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}c7 isn't simply strong enough
<14:45:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}its same with L8
<14:45:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black will defend
<14:45:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and no power at lowe side
<14:45:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but e5
<14:45:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}actually
<14:45:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}goes to lower side
<14:45:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}its 'aim'
<14:45:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is lower side
<14:45:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and
<14:45:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it strenghtens c7
<14:45:49>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DD
<14:45:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so, if black would play d4
<14:45:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for example
<14:45:51>[TALK]{wolfzhou}o  !
<14:45:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}CG
<14:46:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then maybe here
<14:46:03>[TALK]{royc}!
<14:46:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and it already much stronger
<14:46:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}31-41 would be long row and extra pair at 40-42
<14:46:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so, he got to afraid
<14:46:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}of that
<14:46:36>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:46:38>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:46:39>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}CG

<14:48:44>[TALK]{fantasy}defend, also give power to lower side
<14:48:45>[TALK]{zero}block
<14:48:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<14:48:52>[TALK]{SamSite}18-42 gives extra strength to low side
<14:48:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the closest move to lower side
<14:49:03>[TALK]{Fermat}block and lower side is stronger
<14:49:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and still defends black's vct
<14:49:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}right now all my aim is at lower side
<14:49:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and 42 18 make a good inner support
<14:49:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I need it badly
<14:49:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now, he played another VCT1
<14:49:40>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GG
<14:49:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}actually VCF! :)
<14:49:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}where did I close it?
<14:49:56>[TALK]{SamSite}i5

<14:50:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<14:50:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IE
<14:50:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}from lower side again
<14:50:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and now there is something already
<14:50:28>[TALK]{zero}eh
<14:50:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}with precice moves I made something
<14:50:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there are two sides now
<14:50:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black is quite in a trouble
<14:50:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}e4 is very and k5
<14:50:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}2 points
<14:51:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}right?

<14:51:23>[TALK]{Whiz}en
<14:51:33>[TALK]{dalishuish}y
<14:51:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he has 3 choices now
<14:51:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which are they ?
<14:52:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}its logic, 1 is defend right side with k5 another is defend left side with e4 for example
<14:52:23>[TALK]{whywhy}middle at h5
<14:52:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and the third is to try to defend them both with a very passive move- h5
<14:52:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes whywhy
<14:52:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which would you choose ??
<14:52:40>[TALK]{wolfzhou}i think..
<14:52:58>[TALK]{LiuJianping}r
<14:53:09>[TALK]{Fermat}e4
<14:53:13>[TALK]{whywhy}h5
<14:53:13>[TALK]{fantasy}H5 maybe
<14:53:17>[TALK]{termite}h5
<14:53:19>[TALK]{zero}e4
<14:53:21>[TALK]{kaka}left maybe
<14:53:22>[TALK]{wolfzhou}e10
<14:53:25>[TALK]{endlessroad}h5
<14:53:29>[TALK]{H8}h5
<14:53:31>[TALK]{whte}k5
<14:53:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this is very difficult place for white, I can imagine
<14:53:33>[TALK]{Whiz}h5
<14:53:33>[TALK]{sunrain}h5
<14:53:34>[TALK]{shaoping}d5
<14:53:34>[TALK]{wolfzhou}sorry, e7
<14:53:35>[TALK]{amanda}h5
<14:53:44>[TALK]{yyfcsd}k5
<14:53:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}You would like to defend both sides
<14:53:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but you cant
<14:54:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and then u think about the passive one
<14:54:09>[TALK]{wolfzhou}black can make some fours and let the left side become narrow
<14:54:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}fours give extra support for white actually now
<14:54:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}anyway
<14:54:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I think in positional way of looking this
<14:54:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Makarov made the best choice
<14:55:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he played k5
<14:55:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}right side is more dangouros
<14:55:27>[TALK]{whte}y
<14:55:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because there is more space
<14:55:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}space is very important!
<14:56:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if there is little space but many lines
<14:56:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}usually it idn't anything
<14:56:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but simple line into wide space can be very dangouros
<14:56:32>[TALK]{Fermat}y
<14:56:33>[TALK]{casperstar}agree
<14:56:39>[TALK]{fantasy}true
<14:56:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}45-h5 would be very passive
<14:57:00>[TALK]{shuker}.
<14:57:02>[TALK]{shaoping}G3? to control space?
<14:57:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and it would let both sides open
<14:57:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}trying to save them
<14:57:11>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HE
<14:57:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white can have attack at right probably
<14:57:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HB
<14:57:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but can try to get some support
<14:57:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}from left side
<14:57:37>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:57:39>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:57:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so h5 is ogly and bad
<14:57:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ugly*
<14:57:55>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}ED
<14:57:57>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KE
<14:58:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if e4
<14:58:01>[TALK]{wolfzhou}ha
<14:58:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then k5 very strong
<14:58:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and hopefully enough space
<14:58:23>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:58:24>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:58:24>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KE
<14:58:27>[TALK]{zero}space...
<14:58:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so he chose this
<14:58:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}right side is defended
<14:58:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I'm put into this little corner
<14:58:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I'm trapped
<14:58:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}can I win there or not
<14:58:54>[TALK]{wolfzhou}and also 16 support?
<14:59:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}If I'll fail there I'll probably have no chance to win
<14:59:33>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}ED
<14:59:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so 45 was the best move from 'positional aspect'
<14:59:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}right?
<14:59:53>[TALK]{Xespok}y
<14:59:55>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<14:59:55>[TALK]{SamSite}seems so yes
<14:59:56>[TALK]{Fermat}y
<14:59:57>[TALK]{whte}y
<14:59:58>[TALK]{endlessroad}y
<15:00:00>[TALK]{Aurora}.yes

<15:00:05>[TALK]{fantasy}y
<15:00:05>[TALK]{wolfzhou}y
<15:00:09>[TALK]{whywhy}yes
<15:00:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it trapped me to the little corner, took away the space from my right side and also if black could play to right side first
<15:00:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for example L5
<15:00:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then would be dangouros
<15:00:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}soon there will be time problems
<15:00:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}all is important
<15:00:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in real game you need to calculate all possibilities
<15:00:56>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FE
<15:01:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he played f5

<15:09:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he had possible to go b6 or b5
<15:09:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}=)
<15:09:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And he thought 8 minutes
<15:10:14>[TALK]{whywhy}your threat was simply confusion
<15:10:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so there was blitz game possible
<15:10:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<15:10:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}To play such kind of moves
<15:10:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}sometimes
