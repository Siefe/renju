<16:39:53>[TALK]{Guest511}Hi,RT
<16:40:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The most recent even in the world's renju has been the Russian Championship Final.
<16:40:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It ended some days ago, and Konstantin Chingin became the master of Russia.
<16:40:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The second place was achieved by Vlad Kareev
<16:41:11>[TALK]{zhp3410}hello,TE
<16:41:25>[TALK]{virag}but this is not High Leaague in Russia
<16:41:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If I am right, I have only played against those players once.
<16:42:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}virag what do you mean?
<16:42:25>[TALK]{virag}Sushkov and Sinyov did not take part
<16:42:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so?
<16:42:51>[TALK]{virag}may be i am wrong<
<16:42:54>[TALK]{virag}?
<16:43:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I dont understand your point
<16:43:26>[EMOTE]{LiuJianping} says hello to everybody
<16:43:43>[TALK]{LiuJianping}Am I late?
<16:43:44>[TALK]{virag}somewhere i readm, that Russian High League more important than Russian Championship
<16:44:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}russian high league is the russian championship
<16:44:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and that is what I am telling about
<16:44:17>[TALK]{yyfcsd}we cannot say that WC is not top tournament just because Nakamura didnot take part in it
<16:44:22>[TALK]{virag}ohh, sorry , i was wrong
<16:44:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the final of russian championship is called "high league"
<16:44:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the tournament that just ended was the high league of russia
<16:45:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}indeed, some top players such as Sinyov and Sushkov did not join it,
<16:45:16>[TALK]{virag}ok, now i see the definitions
<16:45:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but all the other best players were all there.
<16:45:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The top of Russian renju is dominated by young players now.
<16:45:56>[TALK]{bentley}was kozhin in the torunament?
<16:46:01>[TALK]{strul}It was a real hard top event
<16:46:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Sinyov is the only veteran still being very strong there,
<16:46:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but the rest of them are all under 30
<16:46:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Kozhin did not, as I remember
<16:47:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today we will study the game from that tournament,
<16:47:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}played between Chingin and Kareev.
<16:47:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Kareev - black, Chingin - white.
<16:47:44>[TALK]{strul}a real good game!!
<16:48:01>[TALK]{virag}decisive game
<16:48:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Because of the round robin system,
<16:48:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the match between main rivals may happen anytime,
<16:48:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not necessarily in the end.
<16:48:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So it happened that they had to play with each other in quite early stage.
<16:48:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}There were totally 16 players, 15 games.

<16:49:56>[TALK]{zhp3410}I am here
<16:50:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}These two players have different personality.
<16:50:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Chingin, younger but more calm,
<16:50:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}while Kareev is more passionate player.
<16:51:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}They are both quite creating players,
<16:51:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and spend time on home analyses,
<16:51:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}trying to find new ideas.
<16:52:23>[TALK]{endlessroad}.
<16:52:25>[TALK]{bentley}.
<16:52:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, the game between them was expected by audience,

<16:53:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Chingin took the lead in choosing the tactics.
<16:53:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He chose the 12-h10 with obvious intention to surprise his opponent with something.
<16:54:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I will hold here for a moment, and ask you:
<16:54:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what is your opinion of this 12th move. is it better for white? or black advantage? or what happens here in your opinion?
<16:54:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}please comment
<16:55:13>[TALK]{virag}nobody play it on offline tourny, so not good for white :)
<16:55:34>[TALK]{LiuJianping}I think this 12 is better for black
<16:55:35>[TALK]{strul}Gives white good chances indeed
<16:55:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I hope to see everybodys comment here :)
<16:55:37>[TALK]{scm2000}better for black
<16:55:39>[TALK]{luwenzhe}maybe still balanced. but I prefer black a little bit more
<16:55:45>[TALK]{Red_Zombie}maybe black better
<16:55:50>[TALK]{QBEN}black better
<16:55:54>[TALK]{Andry}black advantage
<16:56:00>[TALK]{bentley}i think black is happier
<16:56:04>[TALK]{yyfcsd}maybe black will be more active at the first stage, but seems hard to finish with promising result
<16:56:06>[TALK]{HEX77}don't know
<16:56:11>[TALK]{swordblue}black batter
<16:56:15>[TALK]{mayhem}black bettee
<16:56:18>[TALK]{endlessroad}better for black,I think
<16:56:22>[TALK]{Aurora}black little advantage
<16:56:41>[TALK]{yun_shou}black beter
<16:56:42>[TALK]{autickocz}i havent played a game with H10 yet..so i dont know
<16:56:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}well,
<16:56:56>[TALK]{shuwang}maybe black better
<16:57:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the most common variants some time ago were something like this:

<16:57:31>[TALK]{QBEN}en
<16:57:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then either simple f9 block
<16:57:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or more aggressive j7

<16:58:47>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KH
<16:58:51>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FI

<16:59:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is very hard to tell the outcome of this,
<16:59:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I have seen games ending very often as black win.
<16:59:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But also, white has enough resources for proper defense and even counterattack in some cases.

<17:00:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Kareev likely preferred the traditional style with 13-j7.
<17:00:27>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JH
<17:00:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So he moved here.
<17:00:36>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JG
<17:00:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This 14 was the answer of Chingin.
<17:00:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Have you seen this 14 before?
<17:00:57>[TALK]{yyfcsd}sushkov used this 14 in WC against taimla

<17:01:35>[TALK]{virag}no
<17:01:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is rather interesting.
<17:02:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Indeed, the way Tunnet played during the WC maybe was not most successful, but also Sushkov played insecurely at that time,
<17:02:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and in overall Tunnet managed to win.

<17:05:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FF
<17:05:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}When I discussed this game with him,
<17:05:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the day after he had played the game
<17:06:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he was still quite emotional about it,
<17:06:15>[TALK]{scm2000}Á÷ÐÇÓêÊÇË­
<17:06:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and said the move 16 being a mistake.
<17:06:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FG
<17:06:39>[TALK]{scm2000}sorry
<17:06:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Actually I did not ask him exactly what he meant by that.
<17:07:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Maybe he meant white should better play the four first?
<17:07:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}What do you think?
<17:07:43>[TALK]{yyfcsd}four at e6 or f7?
<17:07:45>[TALK]{strul}have never seen such 16
<17:08:17>[TALK]{strul}my oppinion creates extra stone for black
<17:08:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I dont know that either.
<17:08:25>[TALK]{Aurora}four first maybe better for white
<17:08:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But what he likely mean was
<17:08:30>[TALK]{QBEN}i thk f6 is better than J6
<17:08:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}after this 17th move black is very good
<17:08:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and white could have done something differently.
<17:09:01>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HE
<17:09:02>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ
<17:09:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Then let us check it later.
<17:09:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}when we have found out the strength of this position.
<17:09:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move 18 was likely necessary and logical too.
<17:09:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move 19 - very brave and active.

<17:11:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white stones inside

<17:12:03>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<17:12:06>[EMOTE]{strul} agrees with yy
<17:12:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Since white has to block lower side anyway,
<17:12:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no need to give the black the powerful k7 stone
<17:12:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is why Chingin played directly to h5

<17:12:43>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ
<17:12:47>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LH
<17:12:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Black seems very powerful now,
<17:13:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I guess it was about to get out of white's control.
<17:13:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Yet, the pair 10_14 was a helpful controller,
<17:13:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and in order to make the 11_19 workable,
<17:14:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black had to play to k7 sooner or later.

<17:49:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not quite,
<17:49:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black could have done it already
<17:49:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}without needing the g12..
<17:49:53>[TALK]{autickocz}ok
<17:50:07>[TALK]{bentley}if white attacks, then it can create many black lines with the help of 29
<17:50:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}one of the ideas you have not mentioned is to re-activate the material of 4x4 after the white's annoying attacker was blocked
<17:50:17>[TALK]{bentley}i guess....
<17:50:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it means, with the move 29, black made the upper RIGHT area alive
<17:50:41>[TALK]{shaoping}see you

<17:51:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black simply played there,

<17:51:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because we spoke in tactics class,

<17:52:04>[TALK]{autickocz}g12

<17:52:27>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<17:52:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}by doing that, we leave ourselves more options to use these fours later

<17:52:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But if we waste them all at first,
<17:53:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we need to play to g12 anyway
