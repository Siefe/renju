<13:49:43>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HK
<13:49:46>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HJ
<13:49:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}10th move is a smart move
<13:50:04>[TALK]{Guest798}the reason why i say theres no win is black has advatage after this 9
<13:50:09>[TALK]{Torsten}and not so common
<13:50:09>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:50:11>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:50:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in many renju games,
<13:50:13>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<13:50:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we put it here
<13:50:22>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:50:23>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HK
<13:50:27>[TALK]{Guest798}how can white win in a black advantage pattern?
<13:50:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and it is risky now
<13:51:06>[TALK]{hobbang}is 10th lose move?
<13:51:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}guest,i just show D3's magic from an example.
<13:51:26>[TALK]{konjin}kick him !

<13:51:38>[TALK]{YKS}please just go on the Game.
<13:51:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}how do you think about gthis 10th move?
<13:51:59>[TALK]{yboil}nice
<13:51:59>[TALK]{YKS}looks active
<13:52:13>[TALK]{casar}maybe dangerous for white.
<13:52:15>[TALK]{hobbang}risky move
<13:52:21>[TALK]{nologic}aggressive looking
<13:52:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}i use it in my games in Group-B of email game last year.
<13:52:28>[TALK]{voshkod}patience is virtue
<13:52:37>[TALK]{YKS}seems let Black attach and if Balck can not win, then,
<13:52:40>[TALK]{alicecooper}good but not sufficient to win
<13:52:48>[TALK]{Torsten}virag presented once a similar move
<13:52:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}i wanna attrack risky:)
<13:53:13>[TALK]{casar}:-)
<13:53:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}let's see the process of the game
<13:53:20>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HJ
<13:53:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he put this 11
<13:53:43>[TALK]{konjin}is this 11 the best black answer?
<13:53:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<13:53:54>[TALK]{Torsten}it's very goog
<13:53:55>[TALK]{Torsten}good
<13:53:57>[TALK]{YKS}seems calm
<13:54:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}just cut black live-2,and make own live-2 at the same time.
<13:54:20>[TALK]{Guest799}.
<13:54:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is really simple!
<13:54:31>[TALK]{voshkod}cautel
<13:54:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but useful!
<13:54:36>[TALK]{konjin}aa, ok, good
<13:54:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we need such move
<13:55:07>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Is this 10th move first played by Nakamura?
<13:55:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}you could hard say where is the area that the black will choose to begin attracking.
<13:56:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe...and when i saw this move the first time,i am amazing it2
<13:56:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}from this 11th,black connects own stone to one whole Area,yes?

<14:08:43>[TALK]{starling}kozi there is the win ?
<14:08:46>[TALK]{konjin}seems this is a key point for black to extend down
<14:08:51>[TALK]{hobbang}center is too strong for black
<14:09:02>[TALK]{casar}lawer side is very dangerous for white...
<14:09:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes,so many good answer
<14:09:08>[TALK]{yboil}17-f8
<14:09:09>[TALK]{Torsten}j9 makes things extremely complex, which is black has more ways to attack
<14:09:12>[TALK]{chess},
<14:09:37>[TALK]{yboil}I think 17-f8 ia a key for black
<14:09:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}k10 is a dead 4
<14:09:39>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KJ
<14:09:44>[TALK]{voshkod}ye,left and lower is risky

<14:31:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}at that time when i played the game,i dont know the win

<14:31:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but my opponent was amazing me
<14:32:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}hobbang,where is 13th?

<14:33:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}good!
<14:33:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he played here
<14:33:25>[TALK]{hobbang}possible 13-k10, 15-k9
<14:33:36>[TALK]{Torsten}i7 first not needed
<14:33:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in fact,i check all my games in renlib file,none chose here at that time.
<14:33:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so i miss it
<14:34:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and i am sure many many players missed it
<14:34:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so i think it deeply
<14:34:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}why we miss this common move?
<14:34:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and why he could find it
<14:35:01>[TALK]{chess},
<14:35:10>[TALK]{Torsten}black has a lot of power
<14:35:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in fact,it is not different,yes?
<14:35:22>[TALK]{Torsten}so one looks for a very agressive move
<14:35:31>[TALK]{hobbang}10th is nakamura move
<14:35:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}could white attrack now?
<14:35:52>[TALK]{casar}no
<14:35:54>[TALK]{Liuchao}no

<14:37:51>[TALK]{YKS}White must defend
<14:38:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this 13th is very easy to understand today

<14:38:27>[TALK]{konjin}GM, are you black, or white? I am a bit confuse now
