<16:40:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Now, we are ready to begin. Today we will revise some games from Spring ORC Qualification tournament.
<16:40:26>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Many people here today :)
<16:40:32>[TALK]{Guest929}sorry...where is the bottom..@@!
<16:40:41>[TALK]{whywhy}guest doesnt neeed that

<16:40:49>[TALK]{Guest929}^^" yes
<16:41:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}We will review some strategic concepts, how to play on offline tournaments.
<16:41:39>[EMOTE]{Xespok} says hi to everyone
<16:41:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Spring QT was an offline tournament with 40 days time limit. There were 28 participants, all of them had 20 games to play.
<16:42:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Maybe some of you followed this tourny.
<16:42:14>[TALK]{Padovan}.
<16:42:27>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yep
<16:42:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Everybody knew that at least 16 points were required to get into top 7 and advancing to the final. So every games were very important.
<16:43:07>[TALK]{whte}.
<16:43:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So, let's discuss about how to achieve a good performance in such offline tourny.
<16:43:08>[TALK]{wolfzhou}y
<16:43:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What is the first task doing at the beginning of the tournament?
<16:43:39>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}opening
<16:43:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So, what would you do at the very beginning of the toury? Please write here your idea!
<16:43:55>[TALK]{mumax}designing
<16:44:05>[TALK]{Padovan}prepare from others weaknesses
<16:44:12>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Check popular openings, and don't play very fast at the beginning :)
<16:44:25>[TALK]{Fermat}haha
<16:44:31>[TALK]{sunrain}oh,play what I like:D
<16:44:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:-)))
<16:44:40>[TALK]{mumax}check which is the worst opening of my opponents
<16:44:42>[TALK]{wolfzhou}agree
<16:44:54>[TALK]{Guest926}the openings are the most important point during the game?
<16:45:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Good answers
<16:45:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}First task is gathering information about opponents.
<16:45:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What type of information are worthy to gather?
<16:45:37>[TALK]{Padovan}openings they don't like :-)))
<16:45:37>[TALK]{wkafei}pop
<16:45:39>[TALK]{Xespok}rating from previous tournaments
<16:45:51>[TALK]{Fermat}opponent's faviate opening
<16:45:51>[TALK]{SamSite}color preferation in openings
<16:45:57>[TALK]{Padovan}openings they lose often :-)
<16:45:59>[TALK]{Xespok}popular opening patterns
<16:46:06>[TALK]{luwenzhe}check their previous games
<16:46:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Is it interesting to gather opponents' favourite foods or soccer teams? :-))))
<16:46:23>[TALK]{Xespok}sure
<16:46:24>[TALK]{Padovan}:-DDD
<16:46:26>[TALK]{SamSite}of course
<16:46:29>[TALK]{sunrain}yeah
<16:46:32>[TALK]{endlessroad}:)
<16:46:38>[TALK]{Padovan}only if you want to go out with them :-DDD
<16:46:42>[TALK]{SamSite}and horoscope is very important
<16:46:44>[TALK]{Guest929}haha
<16:46:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}All information are important that will help you to win the game!
<16:46:52>[TALK]{Aurora}wait till the opponent set the openint first
<16:46:54>[TALK]{luwenzhe}And offering that food for him is he loses :)
<16:47:01>[TALK]{luwenzhe}if
<16:47:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:-)))
<16:47:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Like this: opponents' result in previous tournaments, opponents' favourite opening patterns, lack of knowledge in some opening patterns, playing strength, playing style (aggressive,calm,sharp,defender), renju career...
<16:47:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}All of you answered well
<16:48:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What are the best tools to analyze opponents?
<16:48:24>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Renlib
<16:48:26>[TALK]{Fermat}renlib
<16:48:29>[TALK]{wolfzhou}database?
<16:48:32>[TALK]{Aurora}database
<16:48:37>[TALK]{shaoping}zfive
<16:48:38>[TALK]{Guest929}HEAD
<16:48:48>[TALK]{sunrain}ha
<16:48:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yep, Best tools for analyse opponents are databases, e.g.: Showrenju, Renlib, Stepanov's databases etc.
<16:48:53>[TALK]{wkafei}agree Lu
<16:48:59>[TALK]{Padovan}my renju board :-)
<16:49:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)))
<16:49:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And maybe most important: observing opponents' active games (in progress).
<16:49:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}For example, you can see opponents' games on PBM server, Renju Post server, gambler.ru, ORC client etc.
<16:49:45>[TALK]{Guest926}really have many to be prepared
<16:50:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Old games not so important than newest games. Agree?
<16:50:23>[TALK]{Aurora}yes
<16:50:24>[TALK]{shaoping}no
<16:50:27>[TALK]{Guest929}not agree
<16:50:28>[TALK]{Fermat}y
<16:50:31>[TALK]{ouzo}no
<16:50:35>[TALK]{wkafei}y
<16:50:35>[TALK]{Xespok}y
<16:50:43>[TALK]{Andry}y
<16:50:48>[TALK]{mumax}5050
<16:50:52>[TALK]{Padovan}new ones more important
<16:51:07>[TALK]{whte}y
<16:51:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yep, hard to decide
<16:51:14>[TALK]{Renju_liu_t}Y
<16:51:16>[TALK]{hobbang}new=70, old=30 :)
<16:51:18>[TALK]{shaoping}they have different values
<16:51:28>[TALK]{span}y
<16:51:28>[TALK]{Aurora}old one just for reference
<16:51:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Other problem is
<16:51:36>[TALK]{Guest921}all important
<16:51:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Hardest problem is unknow players...very difficult to choose opening and play against unknow players.
<16:51:40>[TALK]{Renju_liu_t}WHTE HI
<16:51:45>[TALK]{Guest929}haha
<16:52:06>[TALK]{whte}hi,Mr Liu
<16:52:07>[TALK]{wkafei}y
<16:52:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I encountered about this problem on Spring QT, Celie, Sunrain, Fallnavy were "dark horses" for me on the tourny :-(
<16:52:30>[TALK]{sunrain}:(
<16:52:34>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hehe
<16:52:38>[TALK]{span}so we need play at orc by unknown names :)
<16:52:51>[TALK]{Guest929}good idea
<16:52:57>[TALK]{Aurora}dark horse,sunrain
<16:53:08>[TALK]{shaoping}GG
<16:53:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Well, let's see some strategic trick in offline tournaments
<16:53:19>[TALK]{sunrain}hmm,I want to be white horse:D
<16:53:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:-)))
<16:53:34>[TALK]{Padovan}prince on white horse :-)
<16:53:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Very good strategy is "waiting style" at the beginning of the tourny. We can watch what opening patterns use our opponents against other players
<16:54:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}When we have enough information about players, then we can draw a conclusion and we can put opening pattern on the boards!
<16:54:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Who would like to use this style?
<16:54:50>[TALK]{yyfcsd}¡£
<16:55:01>[TALK]{Xespok}if everyone thinks the same way noone will start the game, and everyone will time out
<16:55:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}nobody here?
<16:55:09>[TALK]{Guest929}^^"
<16:55:14>[TALK]{hobbang}here
<16:55:23>[TALK]{span}:)
<16:55:25>[TALK]{sirasoni}.
<16:55:34>[TALK]{Fermat}here too
<16:55:39>[TALK]{Padovan}that's why i wouldn't use this style and win all the games by time :-)))
<16:55:39>[TALK]{wolfzhou}:)
<16:55:44>[TALK]{sunrain}ha,I agree with Xespok
<16:55:47>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}i think few player use such style in QT
<16:55:49>[TALK]{span}haha
<16:55:49>[TALK]{luwenzhe}but what if everybody waits there :)
<16:55:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}After long time waiting will decesive factor the time limit, intenet access etc...
<16:55:58>[TALK]{SamSite}no game is started
<16:56:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}No
<16:56:12>[TALK]{luwenzhe}QT is kind of short
<16:56:17>[TALK]{mumax}yeh,everone watching each other
<16:56:21>[TALK]{mumax}lol
<16:56:29>[TALK]{luwenzhe}in group A of Email WC, many players use this strategy
<16:56:36>[TALK]{Fermat}y
<16:56:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Somebody will start because of he/she would like to win ... :)
<16:56:51>[TALK]{Padovan}yepppp :-)
<16:57:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Why so important to watch opponents' and other players' active current games?
<16:57:31>[TALK]{Padovan}maybe they have better analysis :-)
<16:57:50>[TALK]{Fermat}have more time to prepare well.
<16:57:50>[TALK]{shaoping}To know oppoent's level
<16:57:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yep, Because of the renju theory change and develop day by day! This is very important.
<16:58:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So, you do not like to lose some games easily in the opening phase, then you need to follow all current renju activities on the world :-)))
<16:58:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So you need to have big eyes and ears. There are two english idiom about this
<16:58:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}"To have eyes in the back of one's head" and "To keep one's ear to the ground" :-)))
<16:59:17>[TALK]{tommy}¡£
<16:59:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Maybe you can understand these idioms :)
<16:59:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So, For example, many times I took some good renju theory info when players discussed after RC lesson time :-)
<17:00:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I have some other good tips for beginners to choose openings.
<17:00:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Do not use same opening patterns in many of games, not even that opening is balanced and promising!
<17:00:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Why?
<17:00:44>[TALK]{whywhy}to learn more
<17:00:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:-))))
<17:00:52>[TALK]{Xespok}it is risky
<17:00:54>[TALK]{Padovan}if you lose one, you might lose all the same way
<17:00:58>[TALK]{wolfzhou}yes
<17:01:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Great
<17:01:19>[TALK]{Fermat}donot put all eggs in the same blacket
<17:01:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}There are two reasons: you will get many same games then your opponents can easily play against you: e.g. copying the boards.
<17:01:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Second reason is, what you said: maybe somebody find sure win somewhere, then you will get loss in many games!
<17:02:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Agree?

<17:02:46>[TALK]{tommy}y
<17:02:57>[TALK]{tommy}y
<17:02:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Another tip is: for example, if you have few (2-3) games with same opening patterns, and you know these patterns wins or big advantages then play it rapidly!!!
<17:03:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Why?
<17:03:24>[TALK]{Xespok}saves time for other games
<17:03:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yep, it is paractical
<17:04:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Then your opponents will fall into the trap more easily, because of they will not have enough time to learn theory or analyse the situation.
<17:05:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And maybe other players will not find other balanced line in that opening.
<17:05:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Because of shorter time period.
<17:05:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Understand?
<17:05:42>[TALK]{Aurora}yes
<17:05:47>[TALK]{endlessroad}yes
<17:05:51>[TALK]{Jasny_sokol}y
<17:05:54>[TALK]{Padovan}y
<17:05:54>[TALK]{over}y
<17:05:57>[TALK]{sunrain}y
<17:06:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But be careful, play quick as possible, but all games will be synchronized.
<17:06:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}My meaning is: you need to manage these games so your opponents will be traped same time.
<17:06:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Do you understand me?
<17:06:54>[TALK]{Padovan}y
<17:06:56>[TALK]{Fermat}hard to understand
<17:07:00>[TALK]{whywhy}yea.....otherwise others can escape
<17:07:04>[TALK]{wkafei}i see
<17:07:11>[TALK]{wolfzhou}haha
<17:07:25>[TALK]{Padovan}if you are too fast with one of them, other will choose other branches
<17:07:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}If you had 3 game as black
<17:08:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}All are seems black win, then wait for on all boards that opponents play the worse move...
<17:08:56>[TALK]{Aurora}yes, good idea
<17:09:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Not let him change the branches..., then you can spare the time also!!!
<17:09:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Analyse time.
<17:09:46>[TALK]{Fermat}i see now
<17:10:04>[TALK]{Aurora}if there are some same patten games, you can save a lot of time:)
<17:10:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What is the situation, when you play few same balanced openings pattern?
<17:10:23>[TALK]{Fermat}y
<17:10:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So, What is the best time-table startegy in the unclear (balanced) opening patterns?
<17:11:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Playing all fast, or slow?
<17:11:10>[TALK]{killer21st}no
<17:11:25>[TALK]{Padovan}it depends
<17:11:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What is your idea?
<17:11:33>[TALK]{Fermat}some fast, some slow
<17:11:37>[TALK]{Aurora}maybe try some first, and wait
<17:11:39>[TALK]{shaoping}slow
<17:11:43>[TALK]{killer21st}yes,Fermat
<17:11:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yep, great students!
<17:11:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}If you have few same unclear opening patterns, the best way to gain best result, if you play these games asynchronously.
<17:12:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Namely, play one game quick (e.g. against weaker opponent) and play one game slow!
Then, you can avoid to fall into to the same trap!

<17:40:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Now, Let's speak about preparations.
<17:40:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This is very important field of the renju competition. So try to prepare novelties in the renju theory.
<17:40:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Like suprise moves in the current theory or defect in the old theories.
<17:40:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Have you ever tried to use crazy moves in the games?
<17:41:12>[TALK]{Andry}yes
<17:41:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But be careful, do not use same novelties in many games. Use it only one game, because of it is more risky!

<17:42:00>[TALK]{Aurora}yes, maybe just in the real games
<17:42:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So my advice is: Try to use supprise moves but about 20% of in your games.

<17:57:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Both games were important to decide about top 3 places!
<17:57:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Maybe many player saw this opening pattern.
<17:57:47>[TALK]{hobbang}sure
<17:57:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Both game were same opening pattern! In both games, I was white.
<17:58:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I played slowly both games, because of at that time this position was unclear for me too.

<17:59:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}23th seems very decisive move.....
<18:00:07>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HD
<18:00:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<18:00:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Fifaworldcup played this 25th move.
<18:00:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Here I knew after many analysis, I had good position! I knew white has sure win here.
<18:01:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}All players had 20 days at this moment, but fallnavy did not played this 25th yet.
<18:01:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So I waited...........
<18:01:34>[TALK]{moocheng}fox
<18:01:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Fallnavy also waited....... :)))
<18:01:43>[TALK]{Padovan}:-))
<18:01:45>[TALK]{kaka}hoho
<18:01:46>[TALK]{wolfzhou}hunter
<18:01:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}When I had only 5 days left against fifaworldcup, I played sure win move here.
<18:02:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GG
<18:02:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Fallnavy waited.... after 2 days, he saw games was not avtive game... :-)))
<18:03:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But then, fallnavy had only 5 days left! He realized this 25th move was lose.
<18:03:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So he changed 25th, but it was too late, 5 days not enough for finding best way for black.
<18:03:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In long game white can easily win, because of black has big time presure (5 days - 20 days).
<18:03:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Agree?

<18:04:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And after some weeks
<18:04:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}For example fillipov could not find this 24th move against chinastar, and moocheng also could not find this winning 26th move against nosovs.
