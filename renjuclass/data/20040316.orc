<17:40:28>[TALK]{strul}playable move
<17:40:33>[TALK]{SamSite}black can make mistake easier in this variant
<17:41:14>[TALK]{sunrain}brave:)
<17:41:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}do you understand my question?
<17:41:33>[TALK]{Before}yes, I'm sorry
<17:41:34>[TALK]{Before}:)
<17:41:36>[TALK]{Xespok}I do not like it
<17:41:46>[TALK]{Xespok}just feeling
<17:41:52>[TALK]{luwenzhe}No much feeling coz I seldom play it
<17:41:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}others?
<17:41:54>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}black have adv
<17:41:55>[TALK]{Aurora}this 6 is active move
<17:42:04>[TALK]{virag}i like this type of move
<17:42:06>[TALK]{SamSite}I meant, that this can be good for white
<17:42:09>[TALK]{Guest724}black get more area
<17:42:09>[TALK]{Intotherenju}maybe strongest 6
<17:42:14>[TALK]{Before}it gives to much space to black on downside
<17:42:19>[TALK]{yyfcsd}I find some words from old theory lessons:"the white can be active for some time, but finally when white activity is over, black will be powerful.", but seems maybe white can be better than those words
<17:42:27>[TALK]{bm}i must be good for black
<17:42:30>[TALK]{shaoping}maybe it is a good point for white
<17:42:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Indeed, we often change our evaluations in times.
<17:42:55>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<17:42:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The best example is the d11 opening,
<17:43:04>[TALK]{dhalsim}wow
<17:43:06>[TALK]{virag}sure
<17:43:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which has changed in the range of nearly white win to nearly black win
<17:43:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and now, it somewhere balanced
<17:43:19>[TALK]{liuwenming}Y
<17:43:32>[TALK]{Aurora}true
<17:43:35>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}hehe
<17:43:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}about i11 variant, with this 6th move,
<17:43:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it has not changed much though.
<17:43:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white is a bit active,
<17:44:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but indeed, black will eventually get the control.
<17:44:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But it is a matter of skill and techniques,
<17:44:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how to maintain the control,
<17:44:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and turn it into the success.
<17:44:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The practical games at ORC game server have shown,
<17:44:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that many people are confused about black plans,
<17:44:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and so they fail to make a serious attack.
<17:45:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today's game comes from 1999,
<17:45:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}from Russian city Nizhny Novgorod,
<17:45:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where to strongest players of the city, Kareev and Skuridin met.
<17:46:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}We all know Kareev already,
<17:46:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we saw his game quite recently.
<17:46:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but Skuridin may be unfamiliar to many of you.
<17:46:32>[TALK]{virag}he is a referee
<17:46:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I first met and played with Skuridin in 1989 in the same city
<17:46:38>[TALK]{strul}both play at orc
<17:46:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Indeed, for those who know more about WC,
<17:46:55>[TALK]{SamSite}I played with Skuridin a lot at Gambler last year
<17:47:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Skuridin was the referee of the AT of WC
<17:47:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I have gotten two losses from him in the past.
<17:47:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<17:47:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}One was the i12 opening gamble,
<17:47:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where I did not find black win,
<17:47:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}although I should.
<17:47:54>[TALK]{dhalsim}how many games did you play
<17:48:01>[TALK]{virag}same evil than me, Ando :)
<17:48:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I forgot how many times we have met finally.
<17:48:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}quite many times, surely.
<17:48:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Kareev and Skuridin were about evenly strong opponents in 1999.
<17:49:06>[TALK]{dhalsim}so RT is absolutely better than him:)
<17:49:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today, perhaps Kareev is a bit better.
<17:49:28>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IH
<17:49:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Skuridin is a famous fan of this variant.
<17:49:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Everybody knows it is one of his favorites.
<17:49:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He has used this white tactics against many players,
<17:50:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and for my surprise, he is still quite successful.

<17:50:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}These 11 moves are very logical.
<17:50:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Nearly all games of this variant go through same 11 moves.
<17:51:14>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JH
<17:51:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Also, 12 has become a tradition.
<17:51:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now, I have seen many 13th moves.
<17:51:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If you were black, where would you play the next move?

<17:52:50>[TALK]{Guest724}G10
<17:52:54>[TALK]{SamSite}g11 or K7
<17:52:58>[TALK]{HEX77}k7
<17:53:02>[TALK]{Xespok}g11, k7 maybe k10
<17:53:03>[TALK]{casar}jf
<17:53:06>[TALK]{casar}hi
<17:53:10>[TALK]{strul}i have played K7 to
<17:53:14>[TALK]{Andry}k7
<17:53:19>[TALK]{casar}k7
<17:53:20>[TALK]{LiuJianping}g11 for control
<17:53:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move k7 is quite new.
<17:53:32>[TALK]{yyfcsd}g11, k7
<17:53:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Speaking of history,
<17:53:48>[TALK]{H8}G11
<17:53:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Japanese theory recommends g11 for over 25 years.
<17:54:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And when the renju spred to Europe,
<17:54:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}most European players adopted this theory without questions.
<17:54:21>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GK
<17:54:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Therefore people repeatedly played this move, without questioning other possibilities.
<17:55:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Kareev, also played here.
<17:55:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FJ
<17:55:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This 14th move - a strong defense.
<17:55:32>[TALK]{virag}Yes, adopting without anlyse not good, but timespreading :)
<17:55:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}White can be more gambling, by playing 14-k9,

<17:56:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IG
<17:56:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EG
<17:57:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}anyway, those who feel interested, may study this variant more deeply by themselves.
<17:57:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if white can defend, it is pretty good then,
<17:57:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it seems the upper left corner is quite scary

<17:59:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This 14 is a safe style.
<17:59:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}White is playing passively,
<17:59:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}without taking any risks.
<18:00:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Long time ago,
<18:00:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the Nizhny Novgorod players announced black sure win here.
<18:00:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It was over 10 years ago.
<18:00:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Then Ants Soosyrv replied to them,
<18:00:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}claiming the defense there.
<18:00:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And there has not been any further comments by NN players,
<18:01:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}however, they seem to have started to use this white tactics more frequently after that.
<18:01:17>[TALK]{virag}:)
<18:01:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}There are two interesting issues here.
<18:01:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}One is positional style..
<18:01:48>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HJ
<18:01:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such as this move
<18:01:57>[TALK]{bm}i12
<18:02:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}carefully eliminating whites,
<18:02:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and preparing ground for round development,
<18:02:11>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}how about k7 now?
<18:02:15>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<18:02:17>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KG
<18:02:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is also positional development
<18:02:30>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<18:02:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and maybe some more.
<18:02:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But k10 is completely different style.
<18:02:49>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ
<18:02:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is straighforward, aggressive.
<18:03:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Have you seen this move before?

<18:03:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This was the move the NN players claimed to be sure win over 10 years ago.
<18:04:09>[TALK]{Guest724}seems good
<18:04:11>[TALK]{LiuJianping}What's means of NN?

<18:04:25>[TALK]{Xespok}novgorod
<18:04:27>[TALK]{LiuJianping}thanks
<18:04:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Truth or not, hard to say. According to Ants, it is not a win. And the fact that they peacefully use it even today also shows there should not be too big risks involved.
<18:05:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}11 years ago, Nizhny Novgorod was called by another name - Gorky.

<18:43:10>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}y
<18:43:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Skuridin used j13.
<18:43:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}j13 is better for upper defense,
<18:43:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but on the other hand,
<18:44:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if there are two defense moves,
<18:44:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which both are safe,
<18:44:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then white should choose the one that its most beneficial for self in future.

<18:44:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe the stone at j10 looks too passive and inside
<18:45:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but if we assume that upper side is a "dead area" for both anyway,
<18:45:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and nothing will happen there,
<18:45:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then we think, how the materials of upper fight influence the left and right wings, which are currently quite empty and free.
<18:45:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and maybe the stone 20 can be more helpful there,
<18:46:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}blocking against 10th horizontal line on the right side,
<18:46:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the diagonal of 17_20
<18:46:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, in my opinion, this ugly inside 20 is better this time,

<18:49:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so many opinions, great
<18:49:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}others?
<18:49:16>[TALK]{Guest725}up
<18:49:20>[TALK]{Before}I can't see reason to block it on the upper side
<18:49:40>[TALK]{strul}i can :)
<18:49:45>[TALK]{Before}ok :)
<18:49:51>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}down is very logical
<18:50:05>[TALK]{Guest724}sure down
<18:50:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}thanks.
<18:50:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}indeed, one fact is clear -
<18:50:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the upper side is dead anyway
<18:50:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it is not enough for us, to make the decision.
<18:50:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}namely, we must think of outcome,
<18:50:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no matter of how we block,
<18:51:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black can use the other end, to develop towards lower side.
<18:51:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and we need to evaluate the impact of that development for both cases.
<18:51:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}even if we block at h10,
<18:51:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe the L14 will create enough support for attacks like m10,
<18:52:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so finally black will come out with bigger forces than we expected.
<18:52:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand my thinking so far?
<18:52:08>[TALK]{SamSite}yes
<18:52:09>[TALK]{strul}y
<18:52:10>[TALK]{Aurora}yes
<18:52:11>[TALK]{Before}yes

<18:52:24>[TALK]{liuwenming}y
<18:52:32>[TALK]{hunyi}yes
<18:52:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, remember, we need to compare not only the are alone, (dead or not), but the usefulness of the black material, in developing towards new areas.
<18:52:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In this case, I would say,
<18:53:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is not very easy to evaluate.
<18:53:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is why your answers were quite 50-50
<18:53:36>[TALK]{strul}In my opnion it seems easier for black to develop after down stop
<18:53:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}at least the important thing is that you understand why you decide for one or another move,
<18:53:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the process of thinking.
<18:53:54>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LN

<18:54:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, we have to evaluate the outcomes of both areas
<18:54:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and make final decision according to that.
<18:55:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the fact alone that the upper area is dead is not always sufficient reason

<18:56:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It would be logical that he switches the sides now.
<18:56:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Perhaps he just uses some filling technique,

<18:59:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and this
<18:59:38>[TALK]{FIFAWORLDCUP}i think G9 is improtant point for black
<18:59:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if the second variant is better for black
<18:59:45>[TALK]{strul}sorry missunderstood
<18:59:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then black didnt need to play the four

<19:00:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}hard to say
<19:00:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}again, very disputable situation
<19:00:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i would spend lots of time myself here,
<19:00:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to decide over the usage of black four to g9
<19:00:54>[TALK]{SamSite}maybe here black can attack
<19:01:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, black is definitely looking good here.
<19:01:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}lets see the variant of using the four
<19:01:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}as Kareev did.

<19:01:53>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HF
<19:02:04>[TALK]{Xespok}true
<19:02:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, the best way is to evaluate the outcomes
<19:02:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and since we realized that white was not going to play to g9 anyway,
<19:02:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so there was no hurry to play black four there.

<19:06:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This is what happens to black in such variant,
<19:06:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if they attack without clear concept.
<19:06:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move 15 may be brave,
<19:06:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but without serious planning,
<19:06:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the active style ends up with poor result.
