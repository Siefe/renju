<13:35:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you all know, very soon the renju world championship will begin
<13:35:29>[TALK]{sirasoni}yes
<13:35:32>[TALK]{benben}yes
<13:35:47>[TALK]{xiaolou}y
<13:35:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you can read more information about WC from www.renju.ee/wc
<13:35:55>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<13:35:58>[TALK]{Yue}ok
<13:36:00>[TALK]{coco_yuang}:)
<13:36:02>[TALK]{hui}yes
<13:36:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that website is being updated now
<13:36:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and every day more information appears there
<13:36:24>[TALK]{hui}ok thank u
<13:36:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}most of you never joined WC before
<13:36:46>[TALK]{hui}sure!
<13:36:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you want to become a world champion, you need to get the right to play in AT.
<13:36:52>[TALK]{Yue}Nice website.
<13:36:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}do you know how to get to AT?
<13:36:56>[TALK]{konjin}could you call it WRC
<13:36:59>[TALK]{sirasoni}no
<13:37:02>[TALK]{roger8961}no
<13:37:03>[TALK]{cloud}how
<13:37:03>[TALK]{Whiz}no
<13:37:04>[TALK]{hui}NOI
<13:37:11>[TALK]{xiaolou}n
<13:37:13>[TALK]{slamduk}QT-AT :P
<13:37:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}AT is the tournament where 12 strongest masters fight for the title of world champion.
<13:37:29>[TALK]{konjin}QT first
<13:37:35>[TALK]{Guest361}why?
<13:37:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the 12 seats are taken as follows:
<13:38:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the previous world champion will have personal place to next WC
<13:38:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the previous WC 2-6 places will give national places to next WC
<13:38:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sorry i mean 2-7
<13:38:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}meaning, for example in last WC, estonia had 3rd place in AT,
<13:38:57>[TALK]{slamduk}WoW~perfect website!
<13:39:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}means, estonia gets 1 national seat for this coming WC
<13:39:22>[TALK]{Guest355}``````
<13:39:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}after having played the national qualification tournament,
<13:39:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we select best one, who will go to AT directly.
<13:39:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, theses are first 7 seats in WC.
<13:40:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the remaining seats, 8-12 are taken through international qualification tournament (QT)
<13:40:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such QT is played 3 days before WC,
<13:40:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and 5 best players from that QT, will be lucky to play in AT
<13:40:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<13:40:59>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<13:41:00>[TALK]{slappanu}y
<13:41:01>[TALK]{slamduk}yes
<13:41:01>[TALK]{Whiz}y
<13:41:03>[TALK]{Yue}y
<13:41:05>[TALK]{roger8961}y
<13:41:09>[TALK]{hui}y
<13:41:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Most likely, your renju career will begin from QT
<13:41:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you have the right to play in QT,
<13:41:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then it means, you are about to enter a very tough competition,
<13:41:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because QT is full of scary monsters :)
<13:41:55>[TALK]{slamduk}How many persons will play in QT this year?
<13:41:56>[TALK]{konjin}what means "the right to play", can you detail please?
<13:41:59>[TALK]{Whiz}so difficult
<13:42:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}http://renju.compute.com.tw/~renju/rif/wc/qualifsys.html
<13:42:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i suggest you all read this page later
<13:43:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it illustrates clearly, how to enter QT and AT
<13:43:26>[TALK]{konjin}thanks
<13:43:35>[TALK]{konjin}got it
<13:43:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, imagine, you are one of the people who will play in QT
<13:43:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}(sooner or later it will be reality)
<13:44:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and your dream is to be among best 5 in QT, so that you could reach to AT,
<13:44:20>[TALK]{slappanu}i13 forever then :p
<13:44:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you need to prepare well in order to make dream come true.
<13:44:41>[TALK]{Guest388}你们说的什么呀
<13:44:53>[TALK]{xiaolou}........
<13:44:56>[TALK]{xuwu}.
<13:45:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today I will teach you, how to prepare for QT
<13:45:12>[TALK]{Yue}OK
<13:45:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how to make your chance to win as high as possible.
<13:45:20>[TALK]{slamduk}nice!
<13:45:24>[TALK]{Guest355}..
<13:45:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Many people go to QT and AT without preparation,
<13:45:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so their win depends on luck.
<13:45:42>[TALK]{Guest361}?
<13:45:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If you want to guarantee your success, you need lots of systematic preparation.
<13:46:16>[TALK]{konjin}homework: play in QT, advanced homework, be in top 5 QT
<13:46:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}What do you think, whats the first thing you do for preparation for QT?
<13:46:48>[TALK]{konjin}1. study your opponents !
<13:46:58>[TALK]{konjin}2. study more oppenings
<13:47:05>[TALK]{hobbang}:)
<13:47:09>[TALK]{xiaolou}：）
<13:47:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so quiet
<13:47:17>[TALK]{Yue}3. be relax
<13:47:25>[TALK]{konjin}yes !
<13:47:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}whats the first thing?
<13:47:37>[TALK]{cloud}vacation before it starts.:)
<13:47:38>[TALK]{slappanu}decide one variant to analyse very carfully....
<13:47:39>[TALK]{hui}sleep well
<13:47:40>[TALK]{whywhy}have confidence

<13:48:22>[TALK]{cloud}hehe

<13:48:24>[TALK]{whywhy}=D
<13:48:28>[TALK]{konjin}buy the ticket to go there, that's first, rest is done by force-majore
<13:48:31>[TALK]{coco_yuang}keep  confidence maybe
<13:48:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in a way, you are all correct,
<13:48:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}of course, preparation can be divided into many aspects,
<13:49:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such as travel preparation, body and mind preparation (exercises) etc
<13:49:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but when we speak of renju,
<13:49:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the first thing is to find out who your opponents are.
<13:49:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you have to collect the list of QT players.

<13:50:19>[TALK]{Timo}:p
<13:50:26>[TALK]{Yue}is RT here?
<13:50:32>[TALK]{coco_yuang}AT
<13:50:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i am among the 1-7 AT players
<13:50:57>[TALK]{Yue}o :)
<13:51:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe this QT list will change a bit, but more or less - thats it
<13:51:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they will fight with each other, playing a swiss system tournament with 7 rounds
<13:51:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how many players are there?
<13:51:58>[TALK]{slappanu}more than 7 :p
<13:52:02>[TALK]{konjin}25
<13:52:15>[TALK]{kawamura}I don't know Iio and Ishitani of Japan can participate in QT.
<13:52:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}probably can
<13:52:36>[TALK]{Guest355}```````````
<13:52:41>[TALK]{kawamura}within lating list?
<13:52:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<13:52:53>[TALK]{kawamura}oh good!
<13:53:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but there were some problems with ratinglist dates
<13:53:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i believe it will be solved by RIF CC soon
<13:53:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}lets say, 24 players join QT.
<13:53:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}big question: how many points from 7 games do you need, to be among top 5?
<13:54:14>[TALK]{hobbang}4.5 or 5?
<13:54:14>[TALK]{slappanu}5.5
<13:54:19>[TALK]{konjin}at least 4.5
<13:54:32>[TALK]{hui}5?
<13:54:42>[TALK]{Timo}4.5?
<13:54:46>[TALK]{konjin}all players are good
<13:55:21>[TALK]{Guest373}.
<13:55:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in QT 2001, for example, 22 players played
<13:55:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}http://renju.compute.com.tw/~renju/rif/wc/qttable01.html
<13:55:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}check it
<13:55:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what was the score of 5th player
<13:55:58>[TALK]{Guest355}.....
<13:56:02>[TALK]{Yue}5
<13:56:05>[TALK]{hobbang}5
<13:56:07>[TALK]{paradise}5 as shows
<13:56:10>[TALK]{benben}oh
<13:56:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes good
<13:56:19>[TALK]{Renju_YinLC}晕..........
<13:56:31>[TALK]{shuwang}really hard
<13:56:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, you need at least 5pt
<13:56:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because if 24 players instead of 22,
<13:56:53>[TALK]{Renju_YinLC}ft.............
<13:57:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}7 more points appear to tournament
<13:57:12>[TALK]{Guest361}?
<13:57:22>[TALK]{konjin}14?
<13:57:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no
<13:57:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}when 1 win, another loses
<13:57:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so its 7
<13:57:45>[TALK]{konjin}unclear
<13:57:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}for example 22 players, 7 rounds
<13:57:56>[TALK]{konjin}please continue, i will think to it
<13:57:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its how many pts?
<13:58:13>[TALK]{whywhy}77?
<13:58:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes 77
<13:58:19>[TALK]{konjin}77
<13:58:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so add 2 more players, we add 7 pts not 14
<13:58:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<13:58:41>[TALK]{dogswang}yup
<13:58:41>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<13:58:42>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<13:58:43>[TALK]{Yue}en.
<13:58:44>[TALK]{slappanu}y
<13:58:47>[TALK]{hui}y
<13:59:01>[TALK]{konjin}but then 1 player more, another 7 games will be played?
<13:59:06>[TALK]{Renju_YinLC}在给我上英文课 真晕
<13:59:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that may cause the top 5 score go up nearly by 0,5
<13:59:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}QT has always even number of players
<13:59:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}(timo is reserve player)
<13:59:34>[TALK]{sirasoni}:)
<13:59:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, you need to plan 5,5 is safe
<14:00:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}5 wins maybe, 1 loss, 1 draw
<14:00:19>[TALK]{hobbang}so hard..
<14:00:20>[TALK]{Yue}very difficult...
<14:00:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you play with weak opponent, you dont need to prepare too hard
<14:00:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then you play your favorite variants, which you know well
<14:00:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but for strong opponents, be careful,
<14:01:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because its harder to beat them by your favorite variants, besides, they prepare against you too
<14:01:10>[TALK]{hui}that's right
<14:01:24>[TALK]{Yue}y
<14:01:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}a professional player can guess what you plan to play, even before game begins
<14:01:31>[TALK]{Guest355}````
<14:01:48>[TALK]{hui}??
<14:01:54>[TALK]{hobbang}:)
<14:01:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they will study your games,
<14:02:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in ORC, in renlib files, in database, everywhere
<14:02:05>[TALK]{xiaolou}：）
<14:02:07>[TALK]{paradise}y
<14:02:13>[TALK]{konjin}you should expect the unexpected, even from weak player, (if someone in that reach the QT can be called weak)
<14:02:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}nearly every QT has offered some surprises
<14:02:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}always some "black horse" gets among top 5
<14:03:00>[TALK]{Guest359}？？？？
<14:03:16>[TALK]{Guest359}老师
<14:03:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i hope, some of you will be next black horse
<14:03:22>[TALK]{slamduk}black horse=unknown player?
<14:03:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, a surprise winner
<14:03:32>[TALK]{hui}black horse---leng men
<14:03:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now we will begin to prepare.
<14:04:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in order to make it more real,

<14:19:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}continue
<14:19:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}oh wait a moment,
<14:19:20>[TALK]{konjin}oops :)
<14:19:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you set this opening,
<14:19:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sushkov is sitting against you
<14:19:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he is thinking... does he swap?
<14:19:40>[TALK]{konjin}start with i1
<14:19:59>[TALK]{konjin}someone say if you can play i1 then you can play everythind
<14:20:01>[TALK]{hui}sure swap
<14:20:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no.
<14:20:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will not swap
<14:20:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but he doesnt hurry with white stone
<14:20:24>[TALK]{xiaolou}why?
<14:20:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will think deeply
<14:20:28>[TALK]{hui}??
<14:20:28>[TALK]{Whiz}maybe
<14:20:30>[TALK]{konjin}he like i1 with white
<14:20:39>[TALK]{Guest355}...
<14:20:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}first, he thinks, what is konjin's plan
<14:20:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where is he leading to
<14:20:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}konjin expects classic i1 opening with 4-h10..
<14:21:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so.. maybe escape by 4-h9...
<14:21:11>[MOVE]{konjin}HJ
<14:21:13>[MOVE]{konjin}JH
<14:21:14>[MOVE]{konjin}NB
<14:21:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he think more
<14:21:15>[MOVE]{konjin}GK
<14:21:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and yet not placing 4th move
<14:21:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i guess he will spend about 5 minutes here
<14:21:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}deciding between 4-h10 and 4-h9.
<14:21:47>[TALK]{hui}yes?
<14:22:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}by the way,
<14:22:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}all newcomers tend to play fast
<14:22:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}while masters play slowly
<14:22:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}newcomer has kind of instinct,
<14:22:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because he is lacking real confidence,
<14:22:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so he plays fast moves, to "imitate confidence"
<14:22:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and actually thereby ruins his game
<14:22:58>[TALK]{konjin}that is terrible true !
<14:23:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}som konjin will play super fast,
<14:23:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sushkov slowly
<14:23:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and konjin loses fast
<14:23:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So! first thing, slow down!
<14:23:27>[TALK]{hobbang}:(
<14:23:31>[TALK]{konjin}he he, and he lose slowly !
<14:23:32>[TALK]{xiaolou}:)
<14:23:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you dont need to "show off" by playing fast
<14:23:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}everybody believes you "know theory"
<14:23:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so you dont need to prove it by being fast
<14:24:02>[TALK]{kawamura}Concentration is more important!
<14:24:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}good, hear Kawamura's word
<14:24:09>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<14:24:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}as you know, Kawamura, also a world champion, got 9 from 11 in AT
<14:24:26>[TALK]{konjin}i don't know theory, if he switch to d3, my spirit is gone :D
<14:24:27>[TALK]{Whiz}y
<14:24:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}thats why you need preparations!
<14:24:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you must not only think of your ideas
<14:24:56>[TALK]{kawamura}Interesting tactics, I think.
<14:24:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but about his ideas
<14:25:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you must imagine every step,
<14:25:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what he will do
<14:25:09>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:25:09>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:25:10>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:25:11>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:25:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you check databases,
<14:25:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there are hundreds of sushkovs games
<14:25:31>[TALK]{Guest355}.
<14:25:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if he has almost no i1 games there,
<14:25:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then he will likely transfer to d3
<14:25:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<14:25:45>[TALK]{konjin}yes
<14:25:47>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<14:25:47>[TALK]{xiaolou}y
<14:25:48>[TALK]{paradise}y
<14:25:52>[TALK]{Yue}oh,yes
<14:25:52>[TALK]{derkas}y
<14:25:58>[TALK]{whte}y
<14:25:58>[TALK]{Whiz}yes
<14:26:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}another thing is..
<14:26:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you open d3,

<14:26:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<14:26:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JJ
<14:26:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}will he choose black or white?

<14:26:39>[TALK]{hobbang}w
<14:26:45>[TALK]{kaka}w
<14:27:05>[TALK]{konjin}ando will chose black
<14:27:08>[TALK]{hui}black
<14:27:09>[TALK]{slamduk}b
<14:27:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}hahaha
<14:27:13>[TALK]{konjin}but sushkov??
<14:27:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sushkov might like both colors here
<14:27:31>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:27:31>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:27:32>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}II
<14:27:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JJ
<14:27:33>[TALK]{konjin}i studied ando vs nakamura
<14:27:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i opened database,
<14:27:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and sushkov has 0 games in i1!!
<14:28:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}means, i am most certain, he doesnt want to take risk in important QT,
<14:28:08>[TALK]{Whiz}oh! so he will transfer to d3?
<14:28:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and hopes to overplay you "safely" in d3
<14:28:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes!
<14:28:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will change to d3
<14:28:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because he has no experience in i1
<14:28:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and its foolish to make i1 experiment in such an important tournament
<14:28:47>[TALK]{konjin}true
<14:28:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the good thing is:
<14:28:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you open d3,
<14:29:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then you cannot be sure if he swaps or not
<14:29:07>[TALK]{konjin}then i will play 9-k10, from GM killer21
<14:29:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but from i1->d3, you are sure he will be white
<14:29:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so that will make your preparation much easier -
<14:29:30>[TALK]{Whiz}yes
<14:29:35>[TALK]{konjin}oh, good point !
<14:29:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you only need to prepare yourself as black in d3
<14:29:40>[TALK]{xiaolou}y
<14:29:44>[TALK]{Whiz}it's good idea
<14:29:47>[TALK]{Yue}Nice!
<14:29:48>[TALK]{konjin}got it
<14:29:50>[TALK]{whte}nice:)
<14:30:02>[TALK]{hobbang}=) good tatics
<14:30:04>[TALK]{Guest355}..
<14:30:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such method would not work, if sushkov had i1 experience
<14:30:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but since he doesnt have i1 experience, he will surely transfer to d3
<14:30:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now let go on
<14:30:25>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<14:30:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what will you offer
<14:30:38>[MOVE]{konjin}GI
<14:30:43>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}OO
<14:30:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and another 5
<14:31:07>[MOVE]{konjin}IJ
<14:31:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok
<14:31:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now, main strategy
<14:31:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}tell me, if the game is draw,
<14:31:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}is he satisfied?
<14:31:38>[TALK]{konjin}NO !
<14:31:38>[TALK]{slappanu}no
<14:31:38>[TALK]{hobbang}no
<14:31:41>[TALK]{xuwu}no
<14:31:42>[TALK]{xiaolou}no
<14:31:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<14:31:43>[TALK]{Yue}No
<14:31:45>[TALK]{hui}n
<14:31:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so he will try to win, at any cost
<14:31:49>[TALK]{whte}no
<14:31:50>[TALK]{Ikon}no
<14:31:51>[TALK]{Whiz}no
<14:31:51>[TALK]{kaka}no
<14:31:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, that gives you chance
<14:32:04>[TALK]{konjin}if he get only draw against me (unknown player) then he is gone
<14:32:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}meaning, you dont have to take risks here
<14:32:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you play solid and carefully,
<14:32:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}using positional style,
<14:32:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not sharp style
<14:32:32>[TALK]{whte}y
<14:32:36>[TALK]{xiaolou}y
<14:32:39>[TALK]{slappanu}y
<14:32:41>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<14:32:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}remember! in sharp and complex variants, he is much better counter
<14:32:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will surely beat you by skil
<14:32:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}skill
<14:33:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so if you go to wild attack,
<14:33:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its likely a suicide
<14:33:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}better strategy is: you dont go for win, if you are sure your opponent self needs win very much.
<14:33:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you play calmly, and safely,
<14:33:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will go mad,
<14:33:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because he sees draw coming,
<14:33:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and he will make crazy risks,
<14:33:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}trying to have win chance
<14:34:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and there will be your win opportunity, when he gambles!
<14:34:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will make an aggressive move at some moment,
<14:34:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}(thats his only hope),
<14:34:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and he prays that you will be scared,
<14:34:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and follow him
<14:34:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but if you are clever enough to sense this moment,
<14:35:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and you dont "believe him", and you seek for your own win now,
<14:35:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then you may win!
<14:35:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<14:35:33>[TALK]{whte}y
<14:35:33>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<14:35:33>[TALK]{hui}y
<14:35:37>[TALK]{slappanu}y
<14:35:37>[TALK]{xiaolou}y
<14:35:37>[TALK]{kaka}y
<14:35:38>[TALK]{paradise}yes
<14:35:39>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<14:35:39>[TALK]{Yue}y
<14:35:40>[TALK]{derkas}y
<14:35:40>[TALK]{konjin}yes
<14:35:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you try to win in opening, its impossible.
<14:36:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he knows theory much better than you, he counts more steps ahead than you, he knows all the tactics better, etc.
<14:36:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}his only weakness is "he needs win!"
<14:36:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if you use his weakness well,
<14:36:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you may have a chance to beat him
<14:36:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so lets simulate further game
<14:37:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will pick upper 5
<14:37:01>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:37:02>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:37:02>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:37:03>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IJ
<14:37:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because,
<14:37:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}another 5 could help black force draw situation
<14:37:25>[TALK]{Guest355}.
<14:37:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, we have predicted game until here.
<14:37:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now big question to everybody - where is sushkov's 6th move?? (you can check databases and all)
<14:38:39>[TALK]{Whiz}if i have not the databases,how can i do ?
<14:38:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}a hint:
<14:38:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sushkov likes only 1 kind of 6th here
<14:38:49>[TALK]{hobbang}k10 or j8 or g10 :(
<14:38:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}hobbang wrong!
<14:39:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}dont guess!!
<14:39:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but search
<14:39:17>[TALK]{xuwu}how to search ?
<14:39:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you have to download

<14:40:14>[TALK]{konjin}ok
<14:40:14>[TALK]{slappanu}the database from 2004 is free to download on a japanese site, use google.
<14:40:16>[TALK]{hobbang}interesting homework!!~
<14:40:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}databases prove, that sushkov plays only 6-k10
<14:40:33>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:40:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ
<14:40:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he has about 10 games in this way as white,
<14:40:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and 0 games with any other 6
<14:40:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so that helps your preparation, right?
<14:40:57>[TALK]{konjin}then my 9th is gone :(
<14:41:02>[TALK]{Whiz}yes
<14:41:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}haha now you see!
<14:41:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, dont only prepare what "you know" but what "he plays"
<14:41:55>[TALK]{LiuJianping}.
<14:41:55>[TALK]{yaya}.
<14:41:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you will be surprised by this 6th move,
<14:42:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}means, you didnt do your home preparation
<14:42:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you want to get top 5 in QT
<14:42:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then you must KNOW that sushkov will play 6-k10
<14:42:36>[TALK]{Guest355}.
<14:42:44>[TALK]{konjin}i would not be particulary surprised, because it is one of the 3-4 continuations
<14:42:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}of course,
<14:42:53>[TALK]{konjin}but i will be anyhow in little trouble
<14:42:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but in order to be prepared,
<14:43:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you need to know what he plays
<14:43:09>[TALK]{konjin}yes
<14:43:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because its impossible to prepare for all theory
<14:43:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}our brain will explode

<14:43:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to prepare here a bit
<14:43:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}suggest me tactics
<14:43:56>[TALK]{konjin}i would play k9 or g9
<14:43:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}remember - the strategy is draw game!
<14:44:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}try to find the safe positional way, not sharp game
<14:44:19>[TALK]{hui}J8?
<14:44:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you give up this tactics,
