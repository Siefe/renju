<16:37:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<16:37:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It was the 9th round
<16:38:04>[TALK]{yyfcsd}interesting 12 and 14th move
<16:38:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was 3rd in the tournament table
<16:38:26>[TALK]{mestupid}:)
<16:38:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after Ando and Sushkin
<16:38:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I didn't think about place or anything at that time
<16:39:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}first rounds I just played and then found myself from the top 3
<16:39:12>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Didn't you dream of the champion at that time? :P
<16:39:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was very happy :)
<16:39:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no
<16:39:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}absolutely not
<16:39:37>[TALK]{luwenzhe}That's why you can get it, maybe :)
<16:39:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It didn't even come to my mind :)
<16:39:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yeah
<16:39:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I had a lot of luck
<16:39:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}4 players
<16:40:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that I had to play against in last 4 rounds
<16:40:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}were Ando Sushkov Sinyov and Yamaguchi
<16:40:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It was terrible
<16:40:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Terrible list =)
<16:40:34>[TALK]{virag}yeah
<16:40:42>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hehe
<16:41:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In the tournament my main weapon was D11
<16:41:11>[TALK]{virag}if i can earn 0.5 from 4 players is good reasult for me :))))
<16:41:32>[TALK]{yyfcsd}you got 3.5 out of 4?
<16:41:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I opened it 5 times from 6 of my games
<16:41:46>[TALK]{virag}got 0.5 form 4 :))))
<16:41:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that I had to set opening
<16:41:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}=)
<16:42:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Not that I had liked D11 so very much than other openings
<16:42:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I felt myself quite confidently there
<16:42:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}last round D8 was an exeption, against Yamaguchi
<16:42:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)

<16:43:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes,
<16:43:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}before the last round, in the evening we discussed with Ants
<16:44:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what would happen..
<16:44:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and we thought I have good chances to get at least a draw in D8 with both colours
<16:44:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok
<16:44:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Sushkov chose..
<16:44:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which colour?

<16:47:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IH
<16:47:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This is the main theory
<16:47:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So we placed it quickly
<16:47:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I had expected his next move
<16:47:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that was h10
<16:48:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}very popular now
<16:48:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and it was then also

<16:49:00>[TALK]{bawangwan}J7£¿
<16:49:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}<GrandMaster> but the 14th move was a big suprise
<16:49:13>[TALK]{Guest505}g6
<16:49:35>[TALK]{AUTHOR}J7
<16:49:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It was J7

<16:49:43>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JG
<16:49:57>[TALK]{virag}i need to see it in database, i cannot guess the suprise move, sorry
<16:49:57>[TALK]{killer21st}wow
<16:49:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Before the game I had had a little study about 14-K8
<16:50:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but no way I thought about J7
<16:50:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}He and Chingin had analyzed it against me
<16:50:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)
<16:50:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Anyway, I fell into a deep thinking period
<16:50:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}fall*
<16:51:08>[TALK]{killer21st}:)
<16:51:19>[TALK]{Xespok}fell is correct ;-)
<16:51:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The time control was 120 minutes per player
<16:51:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and after that bayomi 30 moves in 30 minutes
<16:51:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I used maybe 60 minutes here
<16:52:08>[TALK]{luwenzhe}wow
<16:52:12>[TALK]{sunrain}:O
<16:52:18>[TALK]{endlessroad}lol
<16:52:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}After the game I remembered that I had seen
<16:52:23>[TALK]{mestupid}wa
<16:52:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this move before
<16:52:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It was Artemev, who showed me his game against Klimashin in same position
<16:53:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But I ignored those analyzes in my plans during the game
<16:53:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so practically I didn't have experience with this move ;)
<16:53:24>[TALK]{Guest500}KAREEV V. - CHINGIN K. 1 - 0
<16:53:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Klimashin played g6
<16:53:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I played f7
<16:53:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we can see
<16:53:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which is better
<16:54:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)
<16:54:11>[TALK]{killer21st}f7
<16:54:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Does anybody know?
<16:54:24>[TALK]{sunrain}n
<16:54:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or is there more ways for black ?
<16:54:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Please tell what do you think...
<16:54:50>[TALK]{virag}need to analyse
<16:55:11>[TALK]{killer21st}hard to say
<16:55:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Ok, seems so
<16:55:22>[TALK]{virag}what about playing upper area?
<16:55:25>[TALK]{yyfcsd}h7 possible?
<16:55:27>[TALK]{sunrain}white next move may put on L7
<16:55:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}My plan
<16:55:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}was different
<16:56:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}from Klimashin's in his game against Artemiev
<16:56:20>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GF
<16:56:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Their game was like this

<17:15:26>[TALK]{Ando}strong
<17:15:34>[TALK]{Xespok}24 I5?
<17:16:31>[TALK]{Ando}24-i5 maybe better as defense, but white might lose vct threat by that,
<17:16:35>[TALK]{Ando}then black can go freely up
<17:16:45>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<17:17:01>[TALK]{virag}26. h12 and k9 good defences
<17:17:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ye
<17:17:28>[TALK]{Ando}i dont know if this is win or not
<17:17:33>[TALK]{Ando}others maybe help too
<17:17:55>[TALK]{yyfcsd}seems not easy
<17:18:14>[TALK]{Ando}then play 25-e9
<17:18:21>[TALK]{Ando}does it control whites enough?
<17:18:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Ok
<17:18:47>[TALK]{Ando}if yes, then next is h12
<17:18:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}its not easy
<17:18:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}=)
<17:19:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black is quite dangouros
<17:19:07>[TALK]{Ando}and then maybe easier to win
<17:19:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but we must go on
<17:19:11>[TALK]{killer21st}yes
<17:19:13>[GOTO]{GrandMaster}015
<17:19:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Maybe this 15 is good

<17:19:32>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FG
<17:19:42>[TALK]{yyfcsd}positional style

<17:20:00>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GF
<17:20:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Sushkov took g6 point himself
<17:20:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I went on in positional style
<17:20:26>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HK
<17:20:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I didn't think about something like I should get attack panically
<17:20:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or anything
<17:20:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I didn't think about the result at all
<17:21:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}My tactic was just to play

<17:22:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}17-17 I made quickly
<17:22:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and 19 came also quickly
<17:22:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after using a lot of time with the 15th move
<17:23:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I had chose my plan
<17:23:19>[TALK]{virag}yeah these moves are very typical in this opening
<17:23:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I thouvht the position was going to look as it does
<17:23:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after 19
<17:23:29>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FJ
<17:23:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so there it was
<17:23:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and now it was Sushkov's turn
<17:23:57>[TALK]{virag}ohhh, i waited 19th g10 :)
<17:24:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}He didn't chose a standard move
<17:24:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}choose*
<17:24:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok
<17:24:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Whats your ideas here ?
<17:24:42>[TALK]{killer21st}f8?
<17:24:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}How should white play?
<17:24:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Where would you play?
<17:25:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}take your time
<17:25:27>[TALK]{killer21st}f8..

<17:26:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes,
<17:26:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}f9
<17:26:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}seems (and probably is) the most logical answer
<17:27:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The game would have been different if he had chosen that
<17:27:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but Sushkov played e9!
<17:27:13>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EI

<17:27:40>[TALK]{Ando}hm
<17:27:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Interesting move
<17:27:57>[TALK]{virag}maybe too passive
<17:28:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}my answer was in positional style
<17:28:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but theres a way of attacking in a straight style also
<17:28:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Now its time to think a bit
<17:28:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Can black attack?
<17:29:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)
<17:29:17>[TALK]{Guest514}can
<17:29:19>[TALK]{virag}not, but more easily can develop black
<17:29:33>[TALK]{virag}in the right side
<17:29:35>[TALK]{killer21st}maybe
<17:29:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I am not sure
<17:29:48>[TALK]{killer21st}upper right
<17:29:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Sushkov mentioned that black can get strong attack
<17:30:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in his article
<17:30:37>[TALK]{bawangwan}.
<17:30:41>[TALK]{virag}but can easly develop
<17:31:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but there was a mistake in moves sequence
<17:31:09>[TALK]{SSHJ}.
<17:31:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in article :)
<17:31:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So I am not sure :)

<17:36:22>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<17:36:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and my time would be little

<17:40:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he took it
<17:40:10>[TALK]{yyfcsd}balancing the position
<17:40:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now it seems quite balanced position
<17:40:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was the one who chose the game's turn
<17:40:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that means black
<17:41:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Positional style is only black's weapon
<17:41:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there were 2 ways
<17:41:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}to play
<17:41:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I think
<17:41:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}till now
<17:41:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there were 2 points in the game
<17:41:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}where I could have chosen another plan
<17:41:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after 14
<17:41:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and after 20

<17:42:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok
<17:43:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}as Sushkov later told

<17:43:54>[TALK]{yyfcsd}nice pace
<17:43:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the positional style activity
<17:44:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and
<17:44:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}my thoughts
<17:44:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and his

<17:44:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}see it?
<17:44:29>[TALK]{virag}y
<17:44:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}left-lower
<17:44:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}thats probably the only
<17:44:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}place
<17:44:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that somebody can win
<17:44:58>[TALK]{killer21st}good
<17:45:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In this point
<17:45:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if you look the position
<17:45:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is white dangouros?
<17:45:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}at all?
<17:45:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}anywhere ?
<17:45:47>[TALK]{sunrain}L6
<17:45:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)
<17:46:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I think its very likely black will get draw at least
<17:46:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and more likely white would be the one to make the mistake
<17:46:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and in the game
<17:46:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I think he made 2 mistakes
<17:46:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the 1st was now
<17:46:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Which would be the next move you would move?

<17:49:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is much better than j6
<17:49:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in my opinion
<17:49:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but Sushkov did his move quite quickly
<17:49:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JF

<18:01:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in this game
<18:01:45>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LJ

<18:03:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}L11 J9 and h14 i14 f14

<18:03:27>[BACK]{GrandMaster}

<18:04:45>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HM
<18:04:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here I thought maybe 15 minutes
<18:05:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and after that I had maybe 7 minutes left
<18:05:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FD
<18:05:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I might have gotten nervous :)
<18:05:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I had to do a lot of moves
<18:05:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I played this 49!
<18:05:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I thought which is better f5 or f4
<18:05:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}finally chose f4
<18:05:57>[TALK]{tianxia}:)
<18:05:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so the 2 mistakes
<18:06:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he did
<18:06:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which moves they were ?
<18:06:24>[TALK]{luwenzhe}30 and 42
<18:06:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<18:06:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}these mistakes gave me the needed power to win
<18:06:43>[TALK]{killer21st}cool,Lu
<18:06:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}they gave me 23 3 31 connection
<18:07:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and 45 47 21 line
<18:07:05>[TALK]{luwenzhe}to be exactly, 32 and 42 :)
<18:07:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and that made the lower corner powerful
<18:07:18>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<18:07:28>[TALK]{finite555}y
<18:07:33>[TALK]{virag}very powerfull
<18:07:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the mistakes wouldn't have been faithful maybe if these would have made 'lonely'
<18:07:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)
<18:08:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if only 23 3 31
<18:08:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I would have had
<18:08:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then maybe not would have won
<18:08:29>[TALK]{Xespok}fateful ;-)
<18:08:46>[TALK]{Guest514}y
<18:08:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}2 middle mistakes :)
<18:08:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}2 important lines :)
<18:08:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok
<18:09:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and now I'll show you the end
<18:09:16>[TALK]{virag}if 42 at j12, there is now win in the right side?
<18:09:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no
<18:09:31>[TALK]{scm2000}win
<18:09:34>[TALK]{virag}43. K10?
<18:09:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}42-j12 would have defended
<18:09:44>[TALK]{yyfcsd}yes
<18:09:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}its not win, I think
<18:09:53>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FE
<18:10:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in this point he used a lot of time also
<18:10:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so we both had few time
<18:10:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}some 7 minutes or so
<18:10:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but there was nothing to do
<18:10:23>[TALK]{yyfcsd}but seems 50 defend nothing
<18:10:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for white

<18:10:38>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DF
<18:10:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I thought

<18:11:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FE

<18:12:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this is the strongest
<18:13:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}BF
