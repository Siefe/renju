<13:34:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Now, to today's match
<13:34:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}We here in Finland do not have many players
<13:34:40>[TALK]{YKS}a pitty
<13:34:57>[TALK]{Aurora}pity
<13:34:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in the 1st national Championship tournament we managed to gather only 6 players
<13:35:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this year we're hoping to attract few more players
<13:35:23>[TALK]{YKS}no popular in Finland?
<13:35:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}not so many people in Finland
<13:35:44>[TALK]{cloud}do you accept foreign players?
<13:35:57>[TALK]{Guest373}what time the class start?
<13:36:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this year National Championship is closed I think
<13:36:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe next year we might invite foreign players to get bigger tournament
<13:36:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Anyway,
<13:36:19>[TALK]{Guest373}who can tell me,thanks!
<13:36:36>[TALK]{cloud}that would be nice.
<13:36:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}one of the first renju players in Finland was Lauri Toivonen
<13:36:48>[TALK]{cloud}i will think of that.;)
<13:36:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he and Marko Pellikka are from the same town as me
<13:37:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and they introduced me to the game
<13:37:17>[TALK]{Timo}hi
<13:37:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}MArko has played in some WC qualification tournaments
<13:37:25>[TALK]{Timo}I am late?
<13:37:32>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes, Timo
<13:37:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and Lauri managed to qualify for European Championship final in 2002
<13:37:35>[TALK]{Timo}oh
<13:37:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}they both have talent, but not so active anymore
<13:38:08>[TALK]{konjin}bring them to renjuclass

<13:40:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Lauri played black
<13:40:18>[TALK]{Guest362}.
<13:40:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in 2003 we often played this position
<13:40:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}back then, we did not analyse much other than post-game analysis
<13:40:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we just played
<13:41:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What is your opinion on this position ?
<13:41:42>[TALK]{luwenzhe}white not bad, but still hard :)
<13:41:57>[TALK]{YKS}Black can make some attach, but White should hold.
<13:42:29>[TALK]{YeYuwuziqi}w good
<13:42:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}generally speaking, white is better here than black judging from game results
<13:42:47>[TALK]{Guest367}.
<13:42:53>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KG
<13:43:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}often white chooses 16 here
<13:43:03>[TALK]{Guest389}£¬
<13:43:27>[TALK]{YKS}nowadays, 2-k9 played more?
<13:43:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}hard to say
<13:44:00>[TALK]{YKS}12-k9, sorry
<13:44:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the difficulty in this position does not just concern black
<13:44:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it's easy to judge white being stronger, if black follows the move 16
<13:44:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black can not create much there, and white can control
<13:44:58>[TALK]{Guest389}¡£
<13:44:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}a puzling move is 17-h7
<13:45:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HG
<13:45:37>[TALK]{LiuJianping}.
<13:45:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}why does this cause problems to white also
<13:45:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}obviously, it creates lines
<13:45:59>[TALK]{Guest389}¡£
<13:46:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it also threatens some to connect top and bottom black stones
<13:46:36>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<13:46:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so, how to stop this connection ?
<13:47:11>[TALK]{Guest375}£¿
<13:47:24>[TALK]{luwenzhe}i6 often seen
<13:47:36>[TALK]{Aurora}E7?
<13:47:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, i6 gives more power for white on right side
<13:47:50>[TALK]{konjin}i6?
<13:48:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}e7 is maybe an attempt to stop black from using move 15 as a connection point and tkaing over the left side
<13:49:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EG
<13:49:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}could black take tempo here
<13:49:46>[TALK]{cloud}y
<13:49:54>[TALK]{Guest389}¡£
<13:50:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and how
<13:50:18>[TALK]{konjin}i6 :)
<13:50:25>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IF
<13:50:28>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GH
<13:50:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}using i6 makes connecting sides much harder
<13:50:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}therefore black should get power to lower side in order for this to work well
<13:51:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}can black make strong attack purely on lwoer side ?
<13:51:34>[TALK]{konjin}"play where the opponent would like to play" (Go saying)
<13:51:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, it often applies in positional play I think
<13:52:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no ideas for black ?
<13:52:54>[TALK]{Guest362}.
<13:53:01>[TALK]{Guest389}.

<14:22:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and Lauri began his defence
<14:22:29>[TALK]{konjin}huh
<14:23:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it seems white is clear now
<14:23:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because this was offline game, there was time to think
<14:23:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but we had a 7day move rule
<14:23:51>[TALK]{Guest392}£¿

<14:24:49>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KK
<14:24:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}his 35 came fast

<14:26:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}CE
<14:26:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I made a move here
<14:26:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}knowing my opponent, I knew he did not expect such move

<14:27:06>[TALK]{konjin}ha ha

<14:27:38>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:27:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I thought Lauri will think I have a trick on my mind
<14:27:57>[TALK]{konjin}bur he followed you !
<14:28:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DF
<14:28:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and by this I killed more his time
<14:28:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that was only purpose
<14:28:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I needed a win from this game to win the league
<14:28:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after 35 I was worried I might have to struggle in end

<14:32:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}starting from 36, I was only killing Lauri's time
<14:32:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I could win the game on upper side

<14:33:13>[TALK]{endlessroad}4X4 threat?
<14:33:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because I could not find sure win for me
<14:33:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I knew i12+g11 is nice attack

<14:50:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So,
<14:50:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this was a game from Finland, a lesser known renju nation
<14:50:36>[TALK]{luwenzhe}no no
<14:50:42>[TALK]{luwenzhe}we are listening :)
<14:50:48>[TALK]{endlessroad}:)
<14:50:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}you learned about a bit odd tactics
<14:50:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but as most of you know,
<14:50:58>[TALK]{sunrain}with big eyes
<14:51:03>[TALK]{sunrain}:p
<14:51:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in offline game you can choose various streategies
<14:51:11>[TALK]{luwenzhe}you taught well, so we don't need to ask a lot
<14:51:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in this game,
<14:51:31>[TALK]{konjin}yes, lu is right
<14:51:32>[TALK]{Guest389}.
<14:51:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I used several
<14:51:39>[TALK]{cloud}?
<14:51:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}to say were they best choices, is not necessary
<14:52:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is important to know your opponent
<14:52:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}most of the time, you do it by analysing his opening
<14:52:34>[TALK]{luwenzhe}true
<14:52:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}a useful way is also to learn his style of thinking
<14:53:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}with 36 I exploited my idea of Lauri's mind
<14:53:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it along with 52-58 killed the necessary time
<14:53:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for me to win with a position that is not sure win

<14:55:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this win was sadly not enough for me anyway
<14:55:33>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hehe
<14:55:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Lauri finally won me by 1 point in the round
<14:55:40>[TALK]{konjin}he he
<14:55:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but atleast I got to say I beat the winner :)
<14:56:07>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yrah
<14:56:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this game did not offer much new things

<14:56:25>[TALK]{luwenzhe}very
<14:56:28>[TALK]{konjin}yes, it did
