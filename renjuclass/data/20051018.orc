<13:47:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this game is against Mr. Vladimir Sushkov
<13:47:46>[EMOTE]{yyfcsd} says hi to everybody
<13:48:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}One of the strongest player in Russia, maybe in the world
<13:48:29>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HI
<13:48:30>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IF
<13:48:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he opened D12 opening
<13:49:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he already played it 4 times in this WC
<13:49:40>[TALK]{verne}brave!
<13:49:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}2 was QT (1win 1draw), other 2 was AT(1win 1lose)
<13:50:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So it was not so big surprise
<13:50:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Of course I choose black
<13:50:38>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IH
<13:51:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The best move in 5th is of course
<13:51:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JG
<13:51:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here
<13:51:09>[TALK]{findfind}great
<13:51:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So actually he would undo it
<13:51:43>[TALK]{findfind}....
<13:51:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So another 5th was important
<13:51:50>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:51:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I wanted to try

<13:57:16>[TALK]{ice}y
<13:57:21>[TALK]{Whiz}.
<13:57:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}stop white's 3x3 and make line for black
<13:57:26>[TALK]{ice}it is good
<13:57:33>[TALK]{YKS}the other is 11-f10??
<13:57:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yes
<13:57:45>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:57:50>[TALK]{YKS}which one is better?
<13:57:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Another idea is here

<13:58:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}If white pkayed
<13:58:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EK
<13:58:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here

<13:59:53>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HJ
<13:59:54>[TALK]{lq20008}great
<14:00:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in the 8th WC, I also played it against Mr. Igor Sinyov
<14:00:24>[TALK]{YKS}separate Black stones?
<14:00:35>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KG
<14:00:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And I played here and won
<14:01:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}However, some serious players analysed it and
<14:01:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JI
<14:01:17>[TALK]{Whiz}.
<14:01:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}They found white will win from here
<14:01:32>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:01:32>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:01:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GK
<14:01:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Another idea is here but
<14:01:50>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KG
<14:02:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}White has strong defence from here
<14:02:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It is defficult to win for white, but still danger for black
<14:02:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Can you see VCF for white from here?

<14:04:01>[TALK]{Adun}n
<14:04:05>[TALK]{lq20008}no
<14:04:07>[TALK]{verne}n
<14:04:10>[TALK]{YKS}no
<14:04:12>[TALK]{Adun}:(
<14:04:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Somehow this move wasn't play by some years ago
<14:04:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe because of a bit passive
<14:05:05>[TALK]{YKS}yes. seems so, White has initiative.
<14:05:10>[TALK]{Adun}en
<14:05:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But black has advantage in left-upper side and right side's white is not so dangerous now
<14:05:28>[TALK]{xuwu}.
<14:05:51>[TALK]{YKS}White has to chose one side to play first??
<14:06:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}his judge was
<14:06:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EK
<14:06:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here
<14:06:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he played it quickly, so it was clear that he analysed it deeply and had confidence
<14:07:13>[TALK]{lkogr}.
<14:07:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I didn't analysed it very much :P, this was first time to play this 15th move
<14:07:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So I considered here
<14:07:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Does anyone have good idea?
<14:07:53>[TALK]{verne}k6
<14:07:57>[TALK]{YKS}k6 maybe
<14:08:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}others?
<14:08:11>[TALK]{Samsone}H11
<14:08:31>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KF
<14:08:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}does it have VCT?
<14:08:58>[TALK]{ice}n
<14:09:02>[TALK]{blueice}n
<14:09:02>[TALK]{Adun}n
<14:09:08>[TALK]{verne}seems no
<14:09:09>[TALK]{lq20008}n
<14:09:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}you are right
<14:09:18>[TALK]{ice}w  can f12?
<14:09:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so white can attack
<14:09:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FL
<14:09:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}like this or
<14:09:29>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:09:30>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HL
<14:09:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this
<14:09:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black would lost initiative
<14:09:58>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:09:59>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:10:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HL
<14:10:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This move seems to have VCT
<14:10:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but
<14:10:19>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GK
<14:10:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}natural defence made white some attacking place
<14:10:58>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:10:59>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:11:00>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GK
<14:11:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this is also one idea
<14:11:19>[TALK]{ice}f12?
<14:11:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but seems a little narrow
<14:11:37>[TALK]{Guest912}so ,which is best?
<14:11:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So I played
<14:11:41>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:11:42>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FL
<14:11:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here
<14:12:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I cannot assert it was best
<14:12:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but this move make VCT and make space both upper and left side
<14:13:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now g12 is very dangerous for white
<14:13:16>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GL
<14:13:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he stoped it
<14:13:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}how about next move?
<14:13:46>[TALK]{ice}e8?
<14:14:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}attacking is one idea, but there is one important thing
<14:14:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Thanks for exchange of 17 and 18
<14:14:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Now white has no strong VCT threat
<14:14:49>[TALK]{ice}k6now ?
<14:15:12>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KF
<14:15:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I played here

<14:15:37>[TALK]{verne}^-^
<14:15:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no VCT, but positional and spacing move

<14:16:44>[TALK]{YKS}how about 20-j5??  possible??
<14:16:45>[TALK]{ice}j5?
<14:16:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white have no strong VCT threat too, so spacing was the most important tasl
<14:16:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}task
<14:17:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe 20-j5 was possible

<14:38:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It seemd nice defence
<14:38:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And I mixed up and made some mistakes
<14:39:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}some student said 23 had to be K4
<14:39:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FF
<14:39:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}If white play 32-D6
