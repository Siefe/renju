<13:31:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is so nice to see you all here.
<13:31:43>[TALK]{Red_Zombie}hi
<13:31:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The last two weeks have been pretty quiet from my side,
<13:32:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}mainly because I was so busy past 2 weeks.
<13:32:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}That is why you had no homework.
<13:32:20>[TALK]{Before}i c
<13:32:26>[TALK]{claire}hello
<13:32:27>[TALK]{luwenzhe}its all right
<13:32:41>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hi, claire
<13:32:52>[TALK]{Guest691}hi~~~
<13:32:52>[TALK]{Guest695}Great men are always busy
<13:33:09>[TALK]{eastmen}:
<13:33:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Hereby, I will tell you that we will open the sign ups for the renjuclass tournament soon
<13:33:11>[TALK]{leto}seems we are going to be busy resolving all the problems at once :)
<13:33:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we will have two tournaments
<13:33:25>[TALK]{tunnet99}o
<13:33:25>[TALK]{killer21st}wow
<13:33:26>[TALK]{tieuphilac}at the same time?
<13:33:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Final of RCT-4, and QT for RCT-5
<13:33:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<13:33:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}same time
<13:33:34>[TALK]{tieuphilac}wow wow
<13:33:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we already know all the 20 finalists,
<13:33:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but we still make the signup,
<13:33:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to confirm who will play
<13:34:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and who will not respond,
<13:34:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}means silent denial,
<13:34:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so the QT 11th place gets in
<13:34:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}etc
<13:34:31>[TALK]{luwenzhe}so others may have chance to enter final :)
<13:34:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the rest of the people can join the QT-5
<13:34:47>[TALK]{Guest691}kkk
<13:35:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this time, the games are opened automatically,
<13:35:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}thanks to luwenzhe,

<13:36:51>[TALK]{dhalsim}thanks
<13:37:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}We will begin the lesson part now.
<13:37:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you know, our topic is to analyse strong players games,
<13:37:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and to try to understand how they think and why they played certain moves.
<13:37:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Together with that, we usually get some ideas about the opening theory as well as repeating some tactics.
<13:38:09>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HH
<13:38:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The game we will study today is from European Championship 2002.
<13:38:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is so unfair we studied so many male games until now, so to be fair, we have a female player in this game.
<13:39:08>[TALK]{eastmen}:)
<13:39:09>[TALK]{Before}nice
<13:39:29>[TALK]{claire}ha .. I dont mind :)
<13:39:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The black player is women World Champion, Yulia Savrasova.
<13:39:31>[TALK]{dhalsim}who is she, and is she beautiful:)
<13:39:46>[TALK]{Chaos}:=)
<13:39:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}she is very strong player, of course.
<13:39:49>[TALK]{Before}:-)
<13:39:56>[TALK]{claire}yulia ?
<13:40:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<13:40:10>[TALK]{Before}dhalism = romeo
<13:40:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the player with white color is Russian Champion Aleksander Klimashin.
<13:40:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Both are very famous names.

<13:41:06>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HF
<13:41:07>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IH
<13:41:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Klimashin chose the strongest 5th move, and let Yulia attack there.
<13:41:30>[TALK]{claire}wow ..
<13:41:31>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GH
<13:41:34>[TALK]{Before}is there any chance to know about the 5th alternate??
<13:42:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Yulia offered the alternative 5th move to i9.
<13:42:07>[TALK]{Before}thx
<13:42:12>[TALK]{Before}that's booked too?
<13:42:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Actually 5-i8 is almost black win,
<13:42:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it is very complicated.
<13:42:31>[TALK]{Before}brave choice
<13:42:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And Klimashin was certain that Savrasova does not know the win there,
<13:42:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so he decided to let her play the main 5th move.
<13:43:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you see, even in WC final the 5th move occurred so many times.
<13:43:16>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<13:43:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Even I lost there as black . :)
<13:43:21>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:-)
<13:43:23>[TALK]{claire}klimashin is quite careful kind of person , isn't he ?
<13:43:32>[TALK]{Before}he's sly
<13:43:38>[TALK]{tunnet99}LOL
<13:43:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Klimashin is very smart.
<13:43:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He did not join last WC final.
<13:44:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In russia, there are 4 top players:
<13:44:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Klimashin, Sushkov, Chingin, Sinyov.
<13:44:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}hard to tell who is best of them.
<13:44:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But they are the 4 best.
<13:44:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The rest of the players are behind them by far.
<13:44:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<13:45:04>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<13:45:06>[TALK]{whte}y
<13:45:07>[TALK]{claire}even savrarova ?
<13:45:10>[TALK]{leto}I understand this easy part:)
<13:45:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Savrasova may be is not in top 10 of Russia, overall.
<13:45:52>[TALK]{tunnet99}probably not

<13:46:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Savrasova surprised on 7th move.
<13:46:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This is something Klimashin did not expect.
<13:46:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}All top players know this move, more or less,
<13:47:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but not many of them know it very deeply.
<13:47:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Some of them never played it.
<13:47:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Has anyone of you ever played this 7th move, or been played against?
<13:47:41>[TALK]{Before}which one is the usual?
<13:47:41>[TALK]{luwenzhe}no
<13:47:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}usual is 7-f7

<13:48:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This variant became popular in Russia, about 10-15 years ago,

<14:01:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}thank you
<14:02:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Lets look
<14:02:09>[TALK]{leto}welcome
<14:02:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}first the active moves:
<14:02:17>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JD
<14:02:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}many of you suggest this one.
<14:02:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Do you remember,
<14:02:40>[TALK]{leto}space?
<14:02:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what we consider before making a three?
<14:02:53>[TALK]{tunnet99}yea
<14:02:53>[TALK]{Before}no
<14:02:53>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JE
<14:03:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you play the three when you begin VCT,
<14:03:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you play a three when its nevessary for defense.
<14:03:18>[TALK]{Before}ic
<14:03:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you play the three when you are the active side and you use the three to develop some space.
<14:03:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}here, none of them applies.
<14:04:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, in general aspect,
<14:04:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the j4 is a bad move
<14:04:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}of course, we need to keep in mind that there are always some exceptions.
<14:04:23>[TALK]{zjjwf}I am here
<14:04:33>[TALK]{Before}cool
<14:04:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but our principles work well most of the time
<14:04:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you see,
<14:04:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black has an attacking power up on the right side,
<14:04:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, sooner or later white has to defend anyway.
<14:05:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}playing j4,
<14:05:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}simply gives black two important lines:
<14:05:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}j5_k4
<14:05:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and j5_k6
<14:05:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}these two directions will make black attack very powerul.
<14:05:41>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IE
<14:05:42>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GG
<14:06:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you may think:
<14:06:04>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KH
<14:06:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe white can still defend here
<14:06:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}like k8
<14:06:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but the logic is:
<14:06:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you are going to defend k8 anyway,
<14:06:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then dont waste your own material befoire that,
<14:06:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because what you see now is: white wasted both threes,
<14:06:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and black got two benefits from that:
<14:07:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}one is that black got two lines (also f7), and secondly white exhausted its resources,
<14:07:36>[TALK]{claire}yah
<14:07:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, all the white actions before going to k8 were meaningless.
<14:07:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Furthermore,
<14:07:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in case of k8 defense,
<14:08:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we can see black will attack upwards,
<14:08:03>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GL
<14:08:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}For example this way
<14:08:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or something similar,
<14:08:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and now the line 21_3_9 is supporting it.
<14:08:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was not there before white's actions
<14:08:49>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:08:49>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:08:50>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:08:50>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:08:50>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:08:50>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:08:53>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JE
<14:09:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This move, exactly the same principle.
<14:09:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Lets imagine, we have checked all other possibilities,
<14:09:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and they all tend to lose
<14:09:38>[TALK]{tunnet99}how about j5 three and then 20 - k10... if you affraid black would take it otherwise..
<14:09:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}mainly because of black's j5 connection,
<14:10:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then white will consider playing to j5 first.
<14:10:16>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:10:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If white will be in trouble without using j5,
<14:10:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then the three to j5 is justified,
<14:10:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}as its necessary defense.
<14:10:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Understand?
<14:11:00>[TALK]{tunnet99}yah
<14:11:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, before we can answer about j5,
<14:11:07>[TALK]{tunnet99}but
<14:11:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we need to make sure other moves give us trouble.
<14:11:30>[TALK]{tunnet99}possible black's outcome would be stronger with or without j5 even if there is no win... so ..
<14:11:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, this is what i say exception, which happens very seldom
<14:12:15>[TALK]{tunnet99}yes
<14:12:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe 95% of all threes we can always put into our theory

<14:24:26>[TALK]{claire}yah
<14:24:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we have two choices:
<14:24:43>[TALK]{claire}i4 seems good
<14:24:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to block the lines, or connections.
<14:24:46>[TALK]{Before}if white wants develop has play I5 maybe...
<14:24:52>[TALK]{Before}or I4
<14:24:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Moves i5,i4,k8 are line blockers
<14:25:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}while k6 blocks the connections.
<14:25:28>[TALK]{Before}that's seems the strongest
<14:25:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In renju, we want to block the lines often,
<14:25:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because
<14:25:34>[TALK]{lingdodo}i4 may be lost.
<14:25:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we feel that when we just cut the connections, then the lines still stay alive,
<14:26:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and give us some trouble later, through other directions.
<14:26:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}On the other hand,
<14:26:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes we dont have time just to kill one line,
<14:26:26>[TALK]{mumax}one step to lose sometimes means good move
<14:26:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because other lines will attack too strongly through the connection that was left open.
<14:26:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}That is why blocking the line and blocking the connections are equally considerable moves.
<14:27:04>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KF
<14:27:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In fact, this may be the best move.
<14:27:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}blocking the connection.
