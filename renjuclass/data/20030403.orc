<13:30:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now i will explain.
<13:30:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In order to know the answer, we must simulate following moves,
<13:30:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}without taking white moves into consideration.
<13:30:29>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HH
<13:30:30>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EO
<13:30:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move h8 status depends on points f6, f10, j6, j10
<13:31:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if these 4 points are forbidden,
<13:31:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then the lines 17_33_9 and 25_33_1 are dead.
<13:31:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}agree?
<13:31:25>[TALK]{tieuphilac}yes
<13:31:27>[TALK]{killer21st}yes
<13:31:28>[TALK]{luwenzhe}y

<13:31:41>[TALK]{smallpig}y
<13:31:43>[TALK]{Silver}y
<13:31:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if those lines are dead, then the h8 is not a 3x3.
<13:31:48>[TALK]{span}y
<13:31:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now, we need to detect
<13:32:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}are the f6, f10, j6, j10 forbidden,
<13:32:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and because those 4 points are all symmetrical
<13:32:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then it is enough that we only check one of them, for example j6.
<13:32:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}agree?

<13:36:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if even one of the threes happens to be a fake three,
<13:36:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then j6 is a legal point,
<13:36:32>[TALK]{Alan}OK
<13:36:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and therefore h8 is forbidden.
<13:36:45>[TALK]{tunnet99}yea
<13:36:51>[TALK]{Alan}so now go to H6, am I right?
<13:36:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, how do we know if19_3_35 is an open three or not
<13:37:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it depends, whether h6 is allowed point or now
<13:37:17>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GO
<13:37:19>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HF
<13:37:44>[TALK]{Alan}OK, anyway H6 is simlilar as J8

<13:44:31>[TALK]{lingdodo}I think it is just the key
<13:44:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you want to analyse j8, its a different question
<13:44:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}last lesson i spent long time to explain how to analyse forbidden
<13:45:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you cannoy use the reasoning here
<13:45:11>[TALK]{mumax}the final conclsion is based on hypothesis
<13:45:15>[TALK]{Alan}do u agree J8 is similar as H6?
<13:45:22>[TALK]{Alan}from the view now
<13:45:23>[TALK]{moocheng}¡£
<13:45:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}just like last time, we made example where white could defend by fours
<13:45:30>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:45:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no alan,
<13:45:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}let me explain again:
<13:45:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}depending on which point you are trying to figure out,
<13:46:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you must start from the point by putting the stone there
<13:46:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and ask yourself, did i make forbidden move
<13:46:25>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HH
<13:46:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is forbidden.. if...
<13:46:49>[TALK]{Alan}OK, can we put the stone on H8 first?
<13:46:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the following condition is true
<13:46:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}etc
<13:47:07>[TALK]{Alan}let's block one 3 and see another one?
<13:47:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no, Alan
<13:47:20>[TALK]{mumax}and vice versa
<13:47:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}were you in last lesson?
<13:47:26>[TALK]{Alan}yes
<13:47:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in last lesson i told you,
<13:47:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the forbidden point should be analysed without white stones
<13:47:50>[TALK]{Alan}yes
<13:47:52>[TALK]{lingdodo}of course
<13:47:54>[TALK]{shaoping}hehe
<13:47:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you cannot make forbidden analysis, relying on white defense
<13:48:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}like this:

<13:48:24>[TALK]{civsnail}alan, do you understand the defination of 3x3?
<13:48:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}like, for same reason as you said just now,
<13:48:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you can also say that L12 is not 3x3
<13:48:44>[TALK]{Alan}OK, I keep my point, dont affect the lesson
<13:48:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because after we add white stone to m12, black no longer wins
<13:49:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Alan, how do you say that?
<13:49:21>[TALK]{lingdodo}I understand what alan means. He just wonder when we analysis j6, why the stone h8 must be kept.
<13:49:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is RULE, not an OPINION
<13:49:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you all MUST understand renju rules same way

<13:50:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Alan, you can disagree the tactics, or theory, but you cannot disagree rules

<13:50:28>[TALK]{civsnail}Alan, you should read the class material of last lesson
<13:50:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}lingdodo, it is similar:
<13:50:38>[TALK]{Alan}OK, u said cant put any stone, then  u said agian assume 35 on J6?
<13:50:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the forbidden move status should be analysed without the "help" of white stones
<13:51:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how come, you are trying to make "helpful" white stone, after which you can claim, oh it was not 3x3
<13:51:19>[TALK]{mumax}a vicious circle
<13:51:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in order to prove that white cannot influence the "truth"
<13:51:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white will not make any moves at all
<13:51:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}until truth was detected
<13:51:59>[TALK]{Alan}if we analyse the point, anyone, we have to anylyse from the initial stage, am I right?
<13:52:04>[TALK]{lingdodo}when we analysis the patern, we do not add any white stone, just get rid of previous black stone like h8
<13:53:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok according to lingdodo's and alan's thinking,

<13:54:05>[TALK]{lingdodo}just see ando's new pattern
<13:54:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i8 is not 3x3,
<13:54:13>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IH
<13:54:14>[TALK]{lingdodo}yes
<13:54:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because the line1_21_7 is not an open line
<13:54:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}why, becayse g8 is 4x4
<13:54:31>[TALK]{shaoping}the last lesson
<13:54:35>[TALK]{lingdodo}y
<13:54:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now, according to your thinking
<13:54:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we should analyse g8 without other stones
<13:54:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok fine!
<13:54:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so lets go bac
<13:54:47>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:54:49>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GH
<13:54:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}is g8 forbidden??
<13:54:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no
<13:55:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so by your theory g8 is not forbidden
<13:55:01>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:55:02>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IH
<13:55:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and so i8 is forbidden

<13:55:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}just a bit more complicated
<13:55:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but idea just the same
<13:55:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so do you claim i8 is a 3x3?
<13:55:53>[TALK]{Alan}i8?
<13:56:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}is i8 a 3x3?
<13:56:10>[TALK]{Alan}it is not
<13:56:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}why?
<13:56:42>[TALK]{lingdodo}hmm, I begin to understand.
<13:56:54>[TALK]{Alan}19,11 is not open 3
<13:57:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}why it is not open 3?
<13:57:15>[TALK]{Alan}H7 is overline

<13:57:18>[TALK]{lingdodo}when we judge g8 we MUST keep 21 exist.

<13:57:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes lingdodo

<13:58:41>[TALK]{span}i understand now, lingdodo ask a good question. :P i'm also confused before.
<13:58:44>[TALK]{Alan}this one I am clear
<13:58:44>[TALK]{lingdodo}now. everything become clear.
<13:58:44>[TALK]{civsnail}let's alan answer
<13:58:46>[TALK]{Alan}sory
<13:58:55>[TALK]{shaoping}RT
<13:58:56>[TALK]{civsnail}let alan answer, I mean
<13:58:57>[TALK]{shuwang}yes,without 21,g8 and k8 is not forbidden
<13:58:59>[TALK]{Alan}I am still watching another one
<13:59:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Alan, whats your answer then?
<13:59:05>[TALK]{shaoping}I have a advise
<13:59:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}II
<13:59:36>[TALK]{shaoping}can we continue our lesson,we can discuss it after class?
<13:59:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}shaoping, you feel bored?
<13:59:56>[TALK]{lingdodo}I think it is important.
<14:00:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is the lesson.
<14:00:11>[TALK]{civsnail}I think alan should review the last lesson first
<14:00:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and students have the right to express everything they feel unclear about
<14:00:21>[TALK]{shaoping}hehe,the last lesson we learned it
<14:00:26>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:00:27>[TALK]{lingdodo}the rule is not obviously.
<14:00:27>[TALK]{tieuphilac}let's clear this problem here
<14:00:28>[TALK]{Alan}so, we assume 21 is there?
<14:00:37>[TALK]{tieuphilac}and now
<14:00:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}point i8 is not a 3x3
<14:00:59>[TALK]{tunnet99}Its not bad to learn more ... allways better if we are not doing all to fast
<14:01:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because one of the threes can turn into an open four
<14:01:12>[TALK]{tunnet99}too fast*
<14:01:26>[TALK]{shaoping}agree with RT
<14:01:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and we are detecting the g8 and k8 after we play i8
<14:01:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}only then we can see whether it was 3x3 or not
<14:01:59>[TALK]{yzhnie}Alan, the question is if one point is forbidden
<14:02:05>[TALK]{Alan}agree this pattern
<14:02:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in renju, the purpose of not allowing 3x3 was to avoid allowing black win too easily
<14:02:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Alan, if you agree this, then you agree the prevous diagram too?
<14:02:27>[TALK]{yzhnie}how can you make clear it when you not want to play there?
<14:02:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yznie, just play there in your "mind"
<14:02:43>[TALK]{Alan}:) not clear yet
<14:02:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Alan ok I explain
<14:02:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}since you agree that it is not 3x3 here,
<14:03:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because g8 os forbidden
<14:03:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but just before you said,
<14:03:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if we want to detect the following point, such as g8,
<14:03:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we should remove all previois stones
<14:03:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so let me remove 21
<14:03:34>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:03:35>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GH
<14:03:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}is g8 forbidden now?
<14:03:41>[TALK]{weigui};0436?
<14:03:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no
<14:03:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, according to your opinion of removing previous stones, the g8 is not forbidden
<14:04:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if so, then i8 is pure 3x3
<14:04:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand now?
<14:04:15>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:04:26>[TALK]{Alan}ok, get u

<14:06:09>[TALK]{tieuphilac}yes, dont pay attention to the white stones
<14:06:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Of course not.
<14:06:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white is not forced to defend.
<14:06:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the status of 3x3 does not depend on how white defends
<14:06:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}else you get the same situation we just played in upper corner short time ago
<14:07:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where the status of white's 3x3 depended on white's defensive four
<14:07:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Any more questions about the rule?

<14:08:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so that means 37_1_13 is a dead line.. as it cannot make an open four.
<14:09:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and since 37_1_13 is dead..
<14:09:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there is only one real three, that is 17_37_5
<14:09:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so the point h6 is NOT 3x3

<14:29:10>[TALK]{namic_99}h10 is 4x3x3
<14:29:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}indeed
<14:29:17>[TALK]{civsnail}2 real 3 = 3x3
<14:29:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but its same as 3x3
<14:29:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}as long as there arw two open threes, its forbidden point

<14:30:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, the point j8 is forbidden, do you agree on that?

<14:31:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok
<14:31:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so now that we know j8 is forbidden
<14:31:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so the line 11_7_37 is dead
<14:31:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because black cannot go to j8
<14:31:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and therefore the j6 is not a 3x3 point anymore

<14:33:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he asked, whether we should analyse both threes same time
<14:33:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to detect whether it is 3x3.
<14:34:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}answer is "no".
<14:34:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And I explain.
<14:34:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}all comes down to a simple question.
<14:34:28>[TALK]{Alan}thasnks for your patiant explain, RT. i understand now
<14:34:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}double-three is a move that connects two open threes
<14:35:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so you just follow definition
<14:35:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}see if one of the lines is an open three or not
<14:35:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if it is, then you will know it.
<14:36:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you do the same analysis for another three,
<14:36:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or perhaps you have more lines crossing there..
