<16:43:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Before we go on, lets make some opinion check.
<16:43:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}What do you think about this variant after 9 moves? Is it better for black or white?

<16:44:19>[TALK]{luwenzhe}white

<16:45:24>[TALK]{alcore}white
<16:45:24>[TALK]{Xespok}maybe one of those black must be careful, but if defends right, comes out as a winner
<16:45:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It seems this 9th move is quite rare.
<16:45:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In fact, It reminds me of one game on internet many years ago,
<16:46:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where I was beaten by Kawamura.

<16:49:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you are correct - people normally use h10 and L10, which in many cases lead to same pattern.

<16:53:52>[TALK]{Aurora}H7
<16:53:56>[TALK]{yyfcsd}h7
<16:53:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its interesting so many of you show H7 which was Zhang's next move, while in my opinion H7 is not so natural move here
<16:53:59>[TALK]{endlessroad}I10
<16:54:08>[TALK]{H8}H10
<16:54:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so let me ask frankly, are you simply looking the game record,
<16:54:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and repeating his moves?
<16:54:32>[TALK]{yyfcsd}seems the attemp to blcok the 2-12 is dangerous
<16:55:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because, the move 13-i10 should be so obvious,
<16:55:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and you should only think of h7, if you are sure i10 is unsuccessful
<16:55:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, I wonder if you really think by your own mind now
<16:55:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the question here is not to give "perfect" answer,
<16:55:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but I am rather testing you
<16:55:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}about your logical thinking sequence
<16:55:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if I never saw this game before
<16:56:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I would 200% suggest 13-i10
<16:56:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you disagree?
<16:56:29>[TALK]{virag}n
<16:56:35>[TALK]{Andry}no
<16:56:44>[TALK]{bm}n
<16:57:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, the idea of this lesson is not to hear from you what "he" played.
<16:57:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in fact, perhaps his move was not even good, nor logical.
<16:57:47>[TALK]{liuwenming}o
<16:57:48>[TALK]{virag}aha
<16:57:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that way you dont make progress.
<16:57:52>[TALK]{casar}oo
<16:58:01>[TALK]{Analyze}I think  maybe zhang have thought about i10
<16:58:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sure!
<16:58:13>[TALK]{Xespok}i10 maybe the next move?
<16:58:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I am sure he thought about i10 at least an hour
<16:58:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it must have been his first thought and checked this thought for long time
<16:58:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I expected to see i10 from you as well
<16:58:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but for some reason, you all "skipped" 1 hour of thinking result,
<16:58:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and suddently concluded h7
<16:58:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so I wonder why
<16:59:06>[EMOTE]{span} faints
<16:59:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, is it simply copy of record
<16:59:10>[TALK]{Analyze}maybe i10 is dangerous
<16:59:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is my question
<16:59:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because if it is, then your answer is not helping me
<16:59:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I cannot improve your thinking

<17:02:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}killer, are you doing this purposely
<17:03:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}h7 is a move that gives an initiative to white
<17:03:17>[TALK]{killer21st}i dont know why
<17:03:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and there will be long positional struggle
<17:03:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}while i10 is so obvious - kills all white lines, makes great black base
<17:03:49>[TALK]{liuwenming}Y
<17:03:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}do you feel "offended" by my speech about the issue of "self thinking"
<17:04:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so you start speaking like "whats wrong with h7"
<17:04:32>[TALK]{killer21st}sorry.
<17:04:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the point is, you always try to win, before anything else
<17:04:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}same with Zhang
<17:05:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i10 is the most hopeful win chance,
<17:05:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if it only works.
<17:05:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I am sure Zhang spent hour to think of it
<17:05:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}before he gave it up
<17:05:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then he seeked for other choices, and found h7
<17:05:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and those who now suddenly say h7 as first choice,
<17:05:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and say "why not",
<17:06:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it just shows, you are trying to "prove me the Zhang's final conclusion"
<17:06:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but this is not my question!
<17:06:24>[TALK]{virag}yeah, logical thinking
<17:06:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}my question was to see your process of thinking,

<17:07:03>[TALK]{concord2497}y
<17:07:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but this is definitely not logical move
<17:07:21>[TALK]{royc}y
<17:07:27>[TALK]{Xespok}so i10 is not a win, but h7 is also doubtful?
<17:07:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and you should have a serious reason, to reject logical i10
<17:07:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, I ask the h7-voters,
<17:07:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what is wrong with i10
<17:08:09>[TALK]{bm}14to g10

<17:09:19>[TALK]{Guest131}too good is not good, that is )
<17:09:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you mean, Zhang did not want to win too fast,

<17:11:56>[TALK]{killer21st}coz i have played this 13-h7 for 2 years.

<17:13:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how about others?
<17:13:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this 13th move was my "todays trap" to all of you
<17:13:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}having gotten the feeling that so many of you just follow some game records of masters,
<17:13:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I began to worry,
<17:14:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that we are not making any improvement in class,
<17:14:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the skill does not improve,
<17:14:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because you are not telling me your "true thoughts"
<17:14:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but only "best thoughts"
<17:14:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}therefore, to confirm it, I set this question of 13th move for you today
<17:14:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the answer was predictable
<17:15:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The renju class is not a movie theatre,
<17:15:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where we only replay some old movie
<17:15:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but where we study our own mind
<17:15:26>[TALK]{virag}yes
<17:15:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and find its weakness
<17:15:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and try to improve it
<17:15:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I know, some of you feel "upset" about my words
<17:16:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but seriously speaking, the class without "honest mind" is useless
<17:16:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}even if you saw Zhang's record,
<17:17:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you could simply say "i know zhang played h7, but i10 seems so logical, and i would play there, unless it has some unexpected problem"
<17:17:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it would mean, that despite you are aware of Zhang's move,
<17:17:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you did not stop thinking with your own head

<17:30:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is a great 14th move
<17:30:45>[TALK]{yyfcsd}but my feeling about the situation:
<17:30:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not many people can find such move in a few moments
<17:31:04>[TALK]{virag}yes, sure
<17:31:07>[TALK]{yyfcsd}black needs both support from up and lower side to win the game
<17:31:20>[TALK]{yyfcsd}and i10 is important
<17:31:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yyfcsd has thought deeply about it before
<17:31:35>[TALK]{yyfcsd}but h7 or some other moves in lower side important too
<17:31:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, his opinion is based on some long analysis
<17:31:54>[TALK]{yyfcsd}maybe it is problem of timing
<17:32:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is what I meant.
<17:32:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the i10 is logical, but after some analysis,
<17:32:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}some problems appear
<17:32:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and we conclude that black will need some other support
<17:32:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and change of tactics.
<17:32:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Before yy voted for h7, he had deeply thought of i10
<17:32:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so he passed the logical steps
<17:32:52>[TALK]{yyfcsd}maybe zhang want to search support from lower side and he choose h7
<17:32:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}probably
<17:33:10>[TALK]{Guest124}G11
<17:33:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}as I said, in the end we might conclude h7 is the greatest move
<17:33:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but the way to that conclusion is long
<17:33:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if you want to learn how to think in real games,
<17:33:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then you should go through all steps of logic
<17:34:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}else you will be in trouble in real tournaments, where no records help you
<17:34:24>[TALK]{yyfcsd}yes, that's sure
<17:34:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the variant of yy was great
<17:34:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he showed that move 14 offers strong resistance
<17:34:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and can even be dangerous
<17:35:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but before we put down the i10, lets check some more 15th moves.

<17:55:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}For two reasons:
<17:55:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}first, with stones 16 and 18 white had completely killed one area of blacks,
<17:55:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if black still didnt do anything about it, then finally white can kill black's last area too
<17:56:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}second reason was a chance - the 18th move offered black a chance, how to eliminate the potential threat of g5, in active manner.
