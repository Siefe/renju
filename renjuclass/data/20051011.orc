<13:47:00>[TALK]{ice}active
<13:47:01>[TALK]{Guest876}qutie far away - new area
<13:47:14>[TALK]{ice}big area
<13:47:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}How about the other stuents present ?
<13:47:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}students*
<13:47:38>[TALK]{Whiz}6*6 move
<13:47:49>[TALK]{Andry}not very good for black maybe
<13:47:52>[TALK]{skywalker}not sure if white had counters at the top
<13:48:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Andry, care to share your idea why not good ? :)
<13:48:13>[TALK]{Guest878}if White played h10?
<13:48:26>[TALK]{Andry}because no win I think
<13:48:31>[TALK]{Torsten}maybe black win though...
<13:48:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what would be your respond here then
<13:49:00>[TALK]{Andry}I think Ants played correctly
<13:49:02>[TALK]{Torsten}19 seems very mighty
<13:49:06>[TALK]{Andry}he made mistake in the end
<13:49:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ha, Andry knows too much :)
<13:49:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}better not ask anymore from him :)

<13:49:37>[TALK]{Andry}:)
<13:49:51>[TALK]{lkogr}:)
<13:49:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Ants kind of bravely decided to cut the space attack
<13:50:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which seems like the smartest thing to do
<13:50:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}going to middle would result in getting surrounded by blacks
<13:50:21>[TALK]{Torsten}had to block the line 3-19 anyway
<13:50:24>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GE
<13:50:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Timo's respond was quite tough also
<13:51:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}kind of signaling that passive defense might not be enough anymore
<13:51:30>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KI
<13:51:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so he made nice move

<14:00:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}L6 is so obvious
<14:00:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes verne, it creates a VCF threat
<14:00:48>[TALK]{skywalker}oh..but the problem of order
<14:00:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and also is a helpful stone, if further on fight moves to upper area
<14:01:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here, is the moment Andry spoke of earlier
<14:01:24>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LG

<14:03:23>[TALK]{Guest878}very fair
<14:03:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Ants made nice looking 22

<14:07:41>[TALK]{alicecooper}y
<14:07:42>[TALK]{skywalker}y
<14:07:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}usually white chooses 8th to i7 or i10

<14:08:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IJ
<14:08:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FJ

<14:08:37>[TALK]{Andry}no
<14:08:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no
<14:08:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is not white loss
<14:09:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I'm not sure how familiar Johann was with this variant
<14:09:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or Stefan also
<14:09:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}possibly Johann chose here in order to have better chances to win, or do you know Andry ?
<14:09:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}as a surprise
<14:10:10>[TALK]{Andry}he didnt want t play the theory
<14:10:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<14:10:35>[TALK]{Andry}because stefan knows the variants better
<14:10:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}8-i7 tends to make the game pretty easy for black to force atleast draw
<14:11:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and 8-i10 is often risky
<14:11:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe Stefan was not so familiar with the variant

<14:11:33>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LH
<14:11:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}by 16th white secured a pretty good start
<14:11:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}better than with other 8th moves, I think
<14:12:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black is down to one area basically
<14:12:21>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IE
<14:12:28>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<14:12:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}can you explain, why 18th so deep inside ?
<14:13:01>[TALK]{Guest878}cut off inner support?
<14:13:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes good
<14:13:23>[TALK]{Guest876}cut off as much as possible
<14:13:23>[TALK]{Adun}cut 1,7 and 13,115
<14:13:27>[TALK]{verne}to avoid upper attack?
<14:13:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it leaves black very few choices
<14:13:55>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HE
<14:14:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}19 seems like the logical step

<14:26:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}can not say, if this 11th is best
<14:26:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}20th was mistake

<15:13:06>[TALK]{verne}30 seems helpful
<15:13:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<15:13:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe black could play 27th differently to avoid this help line to white
<15:14:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but that is a whole new discussion
<15:14:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Today, we saw some quite interesting games
<15:14:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and luckily we found some nice wins that the players missed
<15:14:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and learned some new moves
<15:14:58>[TALK]{chess}-_-
<15:15:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}all in all, maybe a fine lesson
<15:15:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}hopefully :)
