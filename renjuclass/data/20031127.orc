<14:32:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today I wish to introduce to you another strong renju legend.
<14:33:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Have you heard of the player Nikolay Mihailov?
<14:33:05>[TALK]{serdyuk}yes

<14:33:25>[TALK]{Guest654}who?
<14:33:31>[TALK]{Hannes}yes
<14:33:35>[TALK]{lingdodo}yes but not know much
<14:33:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He was one of the greatest renju players, very very talented,
<14:33:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and very nice person.
<14:34:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Unfortunately he died in 1995, so we cannot meet him anymore.

<14:34:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But before that, he was very strong,
<14:34:30>[TALK]{virag}he was young?
<14:34:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He has won the Russian High League,
<14:34:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes,
<14:34:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he died young, maybe around 30?
<14:34:46>[TALK]{Guest655}he is also strong now!!
<14:35:03>[TALK]{virag}sorry question, how died?
<14:35:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He was the participant in the first WC in 1989,
<14:35:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}also in 1993
<14:36:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He and I played many times in tournaments during those years 1990-1995
<14:36:23>[TALK]{luwenzhe}1995, I didnt even know renju at that time. sigh
<14:36:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I dont remember the total score between us,
<14:36:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but I believe he won more than me
<14:36:51>[TALK]{leto}wow
<14:37:11>[TALK]{virag}database know the truth :)
<14:37:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today I present a game which was played just a few months before he died,
<14:37:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and it was a beautiful game,
<14:37:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}a strong attack by Mihailov
<14:37:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the loser was me of course
<14:37:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<14:37:47>[TALK]{leto}(:
<14:37:51>[TALK]{tianxia}:)
<14:37:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, Mihailov black, and I was white

<14:38:01>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IH
<14:38:04>[TALK]{leto}but great for Mihailkov
<14:38:08>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IJ
<14:38:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}At that time, I was the fan of the stronger 5th move, playing it as white
<14:38:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I had been quite successful as white there,
<14:39:04>[TALK]{virag}yes
<14:39:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but Mikhailov is different class player - his moves were very powerful.
<14:39:15>[TALK]{virag}you play all gamas as white in WC
<14:39:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}oh that was not a WC game
<14:39:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we played in more tournaments than just WCs
<14:39:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the game I show now comes from Baltic Cup 1995,
<14:40:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I want to say,
<14:40:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}his game was always impressive because he used his talent and calculation ability more than theoretical preparation

<14:40:56>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GI
<14:41:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Most of you know this variant.
<14:41:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I had prepared some gambling variants here for white.
<14:41:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}However, I had to face a surprise quickly.
<14:41:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI
<14:41:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He played here instead.
<14:41:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The traditional move would have been 9-h9
<14:41:56>[TALK]{luwenzhe}wow
<14:42:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}What should white do here? Any ideas?

<14:44:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In that game I used h11,
<14:44:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I dont know, if other moves could be better or not.
<14:45:11>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HK
<14:45:23>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FH
<14:45:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The next moves were logical,
<14:45:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EI
<14:45:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The worst thing for me was,
<14:45:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I was in unfamiliar variant,
<14:46:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so my preparation was useless,
<14:46:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I had to count on my skill only.

<14:46:32>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<14:46:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}13- inside move.

<14:48:06>[TALK]{Morden}create lines
<14:48:15>[TALK]{virag}connect and line and white line wrong now
<14:48:23>[TALK]{whte}inner, but very useful,cut white and connect black
<14:48:26>[TALK]{fallnavy}cut white and make one two
<14:48:29>[TALK]{leto}but i think is good because interrupt w activities
<14:48:33>[TALK]{shuwang}agree whte
<14:48:40>[TALK]{SamSite}stops most whtie attack chances
<14:48:43>[TALK]{lingdodo}h6 is black good point but white can not occupy the point
<14:48:50>[TALK]{luwenzhe}blocks white's potential connection and give black some good points
<14:49:26>[TALK]{SamSite}creates possibilites for black on lower side
<14:49:30>[TALK]{lingdodo}at least better than f9
<14:49:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}nice explanations, all of you
<14:50:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i also thing is from this aspect:
<14:50:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}since white has certain activity in move 12,
<14:50:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black likely has to choose between f9 and h9.
<14:50:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In that case, we can just compare them
<14:51:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move f9 is an outside stone,
<14:51:12>[TALK]{Guest631}i like F9
<14:51:14>[TALK]{Guest655}f9 seems good
<14:51:20>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:51:21>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FI
<14:51:26>[TALK]{serdyuk}f7 seems nice too
<14:51:30>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FG
<14:51:33>[TALK]{Guest655}.
<14:51:45>[TALK]{Guest631}yes,F7 also can be tried
<14:51:51>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IF
<14:52:05>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EJ
<14:52:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Since black cannot win in the left wing alone,
<14:52:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will need to use both left and right wings,
<14:52:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but the f9 stone does not much make the right wing any better,
<14:52:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if the right side is poor,
<14:53:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then white may defend more bravely
<14:53:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such as with 16-e10,
<14:53:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}as an example.

<14:54:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}hmm
<14:54:52>[TALK]{virag}write point as .........
<14:55:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe this 13 is good too,
<14:55:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but its much more difficult to find continuation,
<14:55:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}for the reason I mentioned above.

<14:55:36>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<14:55:43>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FG
<14:55:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If we change the 13th move to h9,
<14:56:19>[TALK]{Guest655}how about 14 f9?
<14:56:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then despite being an inside stone, the h9 makes the lower and right wing very powerful.
<14:56:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KG
<14:56:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now, black can play to the right wing safely,
<14:56:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}without worrying about white's counter-attacks.

<14:59:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In that game, I played 14 here, to h6.

<15:00:12>[TALK]{Guest631}seems dangerous
<15:00:13>[TALK]{lingdodo}aggressive
<15:00:34>[TALK]{Guest657}/
<15:00:45>[TALK]{Guest631}if i was the black ,maybe i will choose F7 to start attack

<15:01:55>[TALK]{whte}cant't think a better one
<15:02:02>[TALK]{SamSite}seems brave, but good
<15:02:21>[TALK]{Guest657}.
<15:02:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the word 'dangerous' always confuses me when we use it in renju game, because grammatically it should mean "move that puts opponent in danger"... but often people mean dangerous as "being in danger"
<15:02:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, the word dangerous is most of the time misused
<15:02:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}have you noticed it?
<15:02:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is why i rarely use it myself, in order not to confuse you
<15:03:11>[TALK]{Guest631}and i think sometime ,brave is dangerous
<15:03:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybes its the chinese influence
<15:03:39>[TALK]{luwenzhe}maybe use risk instead :)
<15:03:56>[TALK]{Alan}dangerous should read as "risky"
<15:04:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, please remember, dangerous means, putting someone in danger, threatning,
<15:04:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<15:04:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if talking about self danger, we can use word "risky" move instead
<15:04:32>[TALK]{Guest657}yes...

<15:28:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Right after game, he told me that Nakamura-Yoshizawa game was same
<15:28:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}haha, perhaps.
<15:28:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}However,
<15:28:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he spent lots of time in every move,
<15:28:39>[TALK]{leto}only way to beat you perhaos...
<15:28:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}trying to make new moves,
<15:28:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}however,
<15:29:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}all his conclusions were that there are no better moves than those that Nakamura already made,
<15:29:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so he was forced to follow them
<15:29:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and about me, I didnt know anything at all,
<15:29:22>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Two great players team vs Ando
<15:29:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but the fact that all my moves, including 18, 24 etc, were all same as Yoshizawa,
<15:29:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we can conclude,
<15:29:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that strongest players tend to find optimal solutions in game,
<15:30:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and so their moves will match,
<15:30:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}even if they dont see each others games.
<15:30:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, it proves,
<15:30:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}renju is a very logical game,
<15:30:42>[TALK]{Morden}faint
<15:30:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because only logic can make two game become same like this
<15:30:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, faint.

<15:31:22>[TALK]{luwenzhe}ehhhhhhh
<15:31:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its like two dimensions of worlds
<15:31:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}right?
<15:31:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but good thing was,
<15:32:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes you may wonder what the player is thinking during game, or afraid of, or how calculates, how makes decisions..
<15:32:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and having gone through all these steps with identical game,
<15:32:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i can say that i will know how Yoshizawa must have felt and thought in his game
<15:33:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and maybe i would have never known his feeling,
<15:33:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if this game didnt happen in 1995.
<15:33:13>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hehe
<15:33:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Because the game record analyses never gives us perfect closeness in emotion,
<15:33:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and thinking deepness.
<15:33:40>[TALK]{Morden}poor Yoshizawa
<15:34:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Mihailov was a great fan of Yoshizawa.
<15:34:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He former USSR, he was the only player who had so many great tales and stories about Japanese legends.
<15:35:00>[TALK]{leto}gigant breaker
<15:35:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, he told me a lot about Yoshizawa,
<15:35:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and about his match with Nakamura.
<15:35:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He spoke in very passionate manner,
<15:35:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I admired him for his passion.
<15:35:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}From Mihailov, I heard the first history things about Japanese,
<15:35:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I always remember them.
<15:35:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Many years later,
<15:36:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the old Japanese games were published in database,
<15:36:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and more people got to know them.
<15:36:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but at that time, in 1995, he was perhaps the only foreigner who had the records of the old match from 1980.
<15:37:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Mihailov's words always inspired me,
<15:37:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I became very very interested in renju history.

<15:40:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I realize that there is more in renju than just theory.
<15:40:49>[GOTO]{RenjuTeacher}009
<15:40:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I was so fixed in my thinking,
<15:41:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}assuming people always play theoretical moves,
<15:41:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but as you see from Nakamura's move 9,
<15:41:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}renju offers many choices,
<15:41:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}some may even be better than theoretical moves.
<15:41:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}After game,
<15:41:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I tried to analyse and find defense at some point,
<15:41:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but I could not find.
<15:42:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, this game taught me to see things in new angle,
<15:42:13>[TALK]{luwenzhe}a sure win for b?
<15:42:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to be prepared for any possibility,
<15:42:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not just the known variants.
<15:43:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, I began to think more critically about moves that I play and variants that I prepare for tournaments.
<15:43:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}To make sure ALL choices,
<15:43:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not just popular choices.
<15:43:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If you ask, is move 9-j9 black win,
<15:43:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I cannot promise you.
<15:43:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I just can say that when I analysed it in 1995,
<15:44:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I could not find anything good for white.
<15:44:07>[TALK]{luwenzhe}99% :)
<15:44:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I mean,
<15:44:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I could not find how should white play to avoid loss.
<15:44:22>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HK
<15:44:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move 10 seems forced,
<15:44:29>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FH
<15:44:30>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EI
<15:44:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so is 12,
<15:44:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<15:44:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And here maybe some choices,
<15:44:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but all seem to lose
