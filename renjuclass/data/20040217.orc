<16:50:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today, I wish to bring us back in time a bit, and look into the games played over 20 years ago.
<16:50:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Namely, we will look at the USSR mail tournament in 1883.
<16:50:59>[TALK]{shuwang}1983?

<16:51:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}1983
<16:51:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}thanks
<16:51:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}good you are awake
<16:51:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in 1983 there were not many renju players in Russia,
<16:51:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}only a few of them were good players.
<16:51:58>[TALK]{virag}Nosovsky
<16:52:11>[TALK]{virag}Alexandr Lipsitz
<16:52:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The famous players of that time were for example Biryukov and Maslyayev.
<16:53:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Biryukov was maybe the best USSR player in around 1988.
<16:53:50>[TALK]{Xespok}do they still play?
<16:54:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In fact, he had the right to participate in the first World Championship in Japan 1989.
<16:54:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but he was not among the 3 players that represented USSR in Japan WC.
<16:54:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The reason was related to his work, as I know.
<16:54:45>[MOVE]{coco_yuang}OC
<16:54:55>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<16:55:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It was not easy for some people to get the permit to travel abroad in USSR times.
<16:55:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I have met and played with Biryukov only once,
<16:55:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was the B tournament of WC in 1991,
<16:56:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I played with him in the last round.
<16:56:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He is about 6 dan player.
<16:56:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you can imagine, 6 dan was very high and respected rank at that time.
<16:57:01>[TALK]{luwenzhe}oh
<16:57:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today we will see the game of 1983, between Biryukov and Maslyayev.

<16:58:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In fact, all the 13 moves are very clear.
<16:58:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The theory has not changed past 21 years.
<16:58:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<16:58:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}What is your opinion, students, is this variant black or white advantage?
<16:59:21>[TALK]{luwenzhe}supposed to be black better?
<16:59:31>[TALK]{virag}balanced
<16:59:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}others?
<16:59:51>[TALK]{Xespok}maybe slight black advantage
<16:59:54>[TALK]{virag}black missed best 7th move :)
<17:00:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}others?
<17:00:38>[TALK]{fallnavy}no clear
<17:00:39>[TALK]{Red_Zombie}black maybe
<17:00:41>[TALK]{yyfcsd}maybe white
<17:00:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I want to hear everyone, so we will know where we stand today
<17:00:49>[TALK]{shuwang}I think black maybe better
<17:01:20>[TALK]{slamduk}no idea.
<17:01:22>[TALK]{Guest343}b
<17:01:35>[TALK]{mayhem}seems balance
<17:01:35>[TALK]{shaoping}black
<17:01:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is a very interesting question.
<17:02:29>[TALK]{Guest343}w  surrounded
<17:02:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the opinions tend to change here very often.
<17:02:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Actually, even 21 years later, people still argue about it.
<17:03:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}mostly the argument is about the principles of evaluation.
<17:03:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black is active here,
<17:03:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and strong.
<17:04:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so some people say it is black advantage.
<17:04:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but some others say, it does not matter if black is strong. as long as white is sure to defend, then in the end white will be better - so as a conclusion it is white advantage
<17:04:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and both sides are right
<17:05:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it will finally come down to the simple facts - who is a better player, who makes less mistakes,
<17:05:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and who knows more theory here.
<17:05:48>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FH
<17:05:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Back then, the theory was very "obvious".
<17:06:08>[TALK]{shaoping}what is RT's idea?
<17:06:08>[TALK]{virag}it means balanced then?
<17:06:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, maybe balanced
<17:06:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was balanced if one side does not have clear advantage
<17:07:07>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GK
<17:07:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Both black and white players played with simple style - take basic attack and defense points.
<17:07:41>[TALK]{shaoping}hehe,i keep my thinking,black will good.
<17:08:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}of course, you need to think this way, shaoping, if you are black.
<17:08:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}You must think "positive" about your chances.
<17:08:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Just like when I played with Chingin in last WC, I was black,
<17:09:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I kept telling myself black is sooooo good
<17:09:06>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hehe
<17:09:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<17:09:21>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GL
<17:09:29>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ
<17:09:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you can see, it is all very straight.
<17:09:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}No tricky developments,
<17:09:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no "hidden
<17:09:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no
<17:10:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no hidden meanings
<17:10:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}therefore, their games were somewhat predictable
<17:10:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what do you think about defense?
<17:10:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what is a predictable defense move here?
<17:10:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}as for move 18
<17:10:49>[TALK]{virag}k11
<17:10:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}haha
<17:10:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<17:11:00>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KK
<17:11:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}whenever possible, they made the most logical defense -
<17:11:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}blocking most spaceous direction, from the outside.
<17:11:48>[TALK]{virag}sometimes most logical defense not good
<17:11:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}indeed.
<17:12:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}at that time, the tactics was not good.
<17:12:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}people did not think of building the connections,
<17:12:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or cutting them, as in defense.
<17:12:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in this case, the line 7_17 is a serious connection line
<17:13:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if 20 years ago the players would be asked, what is the most dangerous black line,
<17:13:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they would say 17_9
<17:13:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and second dangerous 3_17
<17:13:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the most silly line 7_17.
<17:13:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the reason of their thinking is,
<17:14:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they just look at the "local impact" of the black pair
<17:14:51>[TALK]{yyfcsd}seems black win in lower side
<17:15:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they do not think globally,
<17:15:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the connections had low value
<17:15:25>[TALK]{yyfcsd}through the connection of 7-17 line
<17:15:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today, in modern renju, the skill of tactics is high
<17:15:32>[TALK]{Xespok}why not 18 h7 first?
<17:15:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}today's masters would immediately say that the line 7_17 is the most dangerous.
<17:16:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the other two lines, although locally active, are not eventually dangerous at all.
<17:16:12>[TALK]{virag}at that they played gomoku, in gomoku not so interesting connections and no many long games
<17:16:15>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<17:16:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Let us first look the game to the end,
<17:16:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then we will critically look over the move 18
<17:16:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and find best solution for white.

<17:24:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok lets continue
<17:24:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In the game, Maslyayev played 20 to the left, as one should.
<17:25:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And move 21 was played to k6.
<17:25:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Please note, it was the mail tournament.
<17:25:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Do you know how mail tournaments were played 20 years ago?
<17:25:44>[TALK]{Xespok}by mail ;-)
<17:25:47>[TALK]{luwenzhe}by letter?
<17:26:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they used the post cards and letters of snail mail.
<17:26:20>[TALK]{Xespok}we sent one postcard from SU to Hungary
<17:26:28>[TALK]{Xespok}it took more than 1 year
<17:26:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Does anyone of you have such experience?
<17:26:33>[TALK]{Xespok}slow games ;-)
<17:27:02>[TALK]{luwenzhe}never
<17:27:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I played two times.
<17:27:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was an amazing experience.
<17:27:54>[TALK]{virag}may be postal dove (pigeons) better solution :)))
<17:27:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the thinking time was maybe around 40 days
<17:28:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not including the delivery time
<17:28:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Usually, the speed of delivery was like 10 days
<17:28:28>[TALK]{Xespok}you are still playing?
<17:28:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}haha no
<17:28:58>[TALK]{Xespok}100 mocves 5000 days
<17:29:01>[TALK]{Xespok}15 years
<17:29:08>[TALK]{Xespok}x2
<17:29:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}people used the stamp record on the postcard, to check time log
<17:29:28>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hehe
<17:29:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}indeed, the speed was slow,
<17:29:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but games did not last too long,
<17:29:39>[TALK]{yyfcsd}any referee?
<17:29:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe 6 months
<17:29:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<17:29:46>[TALK]{virag}inner side USSR it was ok, but outside not
<17:29:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there was a referee too
<17:29:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}usually, to speed up the games,
<17:30:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the players offered if-variants
<17:30:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}like, if you play 12-g6 then I put 13-g7
<17:30:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}etc
<17:30:21>[TALK]{luwenzhe}haha
<17:30:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, sometimes, i sent the if-branches up to 7 moves deep
<17:30:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}on 3 pages of letter
<17:30:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<17:30:43>[TALK]{virag}in the endgame and in the opening it is good
<17:30:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so if he accepted one branch, we had 7 moves done at once
<17:30:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}good eh?
<17:31:13>[TALK]{Xespok}this should be done also on RC tournaments
<17:31:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was good in theory variants, such as this one.
<17:31:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It might be that one player made suggestion up to 13th move
<17:32:07>[TALK]{virag}in the middle game , it is not good beacuse opponent can find mistake in branch :)
<17:32:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and upon accepting, the game jumped to move 13
<17:32:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<17:32:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}haha right
<17:32:28>[TALK]{yyfcsd}any possibility of if you play 12-h6, then I resign?:)
<17:32:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so when people sent me the branches
<17:32:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I always digged into them, to find weaknesses
<17:32:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and sometimes it saved me from loss
<17:32:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I chose the "saving" branch
<17:33:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}haha yy
<17:33:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I remember, I used branches in sure win situations
<17:33:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}actually, we can call it a grandfather of todays homeworks
<17:33:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}from the moment I had vct win,
<17:34:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i made the tree of all moves and branches
<17:34:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and sent to opponent
<17:34:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}on many pages
<17:34:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}today, renlib is sooo convenient
<17:34:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but back then, really lots of handwork
<17:34:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:))
<17:34:36>[TALK]{yyfcsd}thanks to GAWA
<17:34:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in fact, the earliest students of renjuclass still might remember our first hws
<17:34:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they were also hand made trees
<17:35:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe luwenzhe remembers?
<17:35:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}renlib came much later
<17:35:21>[TALK]{luwenzhe}sure
<17:35:24>[TALK]{fallnavy}hand made?
<17:35:25>[TALK]{luwenzhe}I made images
<17:35:28>[TALK]{yyfcsd}yes, can be found in early lesson materials
<17:35:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now it feels like Stone Age
<17:35:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:))
<17:35:44>[TALK]{shaoping}ha,i know
<17:35:46>[TALK]{fallnavy}send HW by post?
<17:35:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sent by email, but branches are manually composed
<17:36:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}like, some people made with notation
<17:36:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if h8 then j9...
<17:36:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if f6 then..
<17:36:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and so on
<17:36:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}some people sent image files, one by one
<17:36:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}one image for each branch
<17:36:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}jpg files
<17:36:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<17:36:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or as the Word document files
<17:37:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}one thing about mail tournaments was -
<17:37:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes mails got lost!
<17:37:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and it was really bad.
<17:37:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it often took over 1-2 months to resume game
<17:37:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if some letter was lost
<17:38:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Well, good thing was,
<17:38:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we had tons of free time
<17:38:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to study games deeply
<17:38:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}although the skill was poor
<17:38:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Let us look at the game here,
<17:38:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Biryukov played 21-k6
<17:38:46>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}MF
<17:38:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Maslyayev put to the right.
<17:39:03>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HG
<17:39:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And after 23rd move, Maslyayev resigned.
<17:39:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Some interesting observations:
<17:39:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was a mail tournament, and commonly, players seeing the sure win, sent their opponents the branches, proving the win on any block.
<17:40:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then if opponent did not see any bugs there, he just resigned without making any move.
<17:40:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Maslyayev did not resign at move 22
<17:41:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which means, Biryukov did not send out the branches
<17:41:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe because of no win, or he was too lazy?
<17:41:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}each mail = 1 post card = money
<17:42:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, the more branches, the less money
<17:42:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?

<17:42:09>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<17:42:10>[TALK]{Xespok}y
<17:42:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe they were rich players :)
<17:42:29>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hehe
<17:42:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now, lets see, why Maslyayev resigned.
<17:42:41>[TALK]{shaoping}wow
<17:42:41>[TALK]{virag}may be he want avoid 22 i6
<17:42:45>[TALK]{yyfcsd}maybe he sent, and white found bugs?
<17:42:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Who can show win, say ME
<17:43:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yy, if he sent branch, then white can accept and submit the whole branch into game
<17:43:26>[TALK]{yyfcsd}oh
<17:43:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but as you saw, just 1 black move and then white gave up
<17:43:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes, when people sent me a buggy branch,
<17:43:58>[TALK]{virag}he did not find win in time
<17:44:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I accepted it happily and submitted it,
