<16:40:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Todays game shows the fight between two great masters.
<16:41:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Black: Igor Sinyov, from Russia
<16:41:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}White: Makoto Yamaguchi, from Japan
<16:41:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they are both the champions of their country.
<16:41:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and they both have the 2nd place from WC, too.
<16:42:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}history puzzle for you:
<16:42:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which year did Yamaguchi get WC 2nd place and which year did Sinyov?

<16:44:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I see :)
<16:45:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, these two great players met again in 2003 WC.
<16:45:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And our today's game comes from there.
<16:45:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<16:45:35>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HF
<16:45:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As already said, Sinyov was black here.
<16:46:05>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JG
<16:46:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This 5th move is gaining popularity these years.
<16:46:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Some years ago, it was rarely used.
<16:47:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but now, it is perhaps even more frequently used than 5-i9.
<16:47:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Of course, there are some variations,
<16:47:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}some people use 5-j8, other 5-j7.
<16:47:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}are they same?
<16:47:40>[TALK]{killer21st}no
<16:47:42>[TALK]{SamSite}no

<16:48:05>[TALK]{virag}j8 more balanced
<16:48:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}hmm
<16:48:11>[TALK]{endlessroad}.
<16:48:12>[TALK]{QBEN}why?
<16:48:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in my opinion, both have their advantages
<16:48:18>[TALK]{killer21st}:)
<16:48:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and shortcomings too
<16:48:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white is required to defend differently,
<16:48:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}depending on which 5th was used.

<17:19:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the way he played shows quite well about the essence of this variant
<17:19:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in fact, most games of this variant go in similar manner
<17:19:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}first white is active in lower corner,
<17:19:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then black spends some material to balance,
<17:20:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then white goes to upper side to defend,
<17:20:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the battle goes on.
<17:20:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Even today, it is hard for me to say who really has an advantage here.

<17:20:44>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}ED
<17:20:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}probably with this 20 white can keep more open structures for self
<17:21:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}anyway, this variant is very exciting,
<17:21:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but for some reason rarely played.
<17:21:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<17:21:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And for that reason Sinyov likely decided to try this 7th move.

<17:25:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is a hard moment for white.
<17:25:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}One would need to play aggressively now, to avoid being surrounded.
<17:25:38>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GF
<17:25:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So Yamaguchi did.
<17:25:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He played a courageous 10th move.
<17:26:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And by that, he put a serious task in front of Sinyov - to find win, or fail.
<17:26:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Because positional style is not so easily reached now.
<17:26:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}You can now take a moment to think about black plan here, and we make a small participation check.

<17:29:37>[TALK]{Xespok}h10 seems natural, but I find no easy continuation, since 1-9 diagonal is blocked

<17:31:14>[TALK]{yyfcsd}h10 is not a idea of just being active, it force white to defence at i11 and better support for lower side defence
