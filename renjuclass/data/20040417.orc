<16:39:47>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JJ
<16:39:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Today we can begin with learning a new opening. This is the D3 opening!
<16:39:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}As it is the most balanced opening, therefore we seldom can show winning endings for either side.
<16:40:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}We will try to analyse and discuss those variants and end them when we have clear understanding about the advantage issue.
<16:40:30>[TALK]{luwenzhe}good
<16:40:45>[TALK]{dhalsim}expecting
<16:40:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I think many players used this opening :)
<16:40:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}D3 is very hard opening pattern, much of D3 games are very long (about 60-80 moves), so it smile on for white strategy.
<16:41:18>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:)
<16:41:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The D3 opening principally positional style opening may be this is the reason for long games and most of players do not like to swap and choose white here :-)
<16:41:44>[TALK]{killer21st}:)
<16:41:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But we have to emphasize, black has many new ideas to surprise white. I think D3 has most "desert island" in the Renju theory!

<16:43:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Today we will investigate 5th at i11. This move is considered to be not the strongest 5th move :-)
<16:44:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What do you think about this 5th? Does white or black favor?
<16:44:04>[TALK]{tunnet99}Maybe 4-i10 is quite hard
<16:44:08>[TALK]{killer21st}white
<16:44:19>[TALK]{Padovan}yep, tunnet

<16:44:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IK
<16:44:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This 5th is considered to be little white advantage. But I remember, 8 years ago Leonid Gluhovsky defeated me in this opening with black. That time, this 5th move suprised me.
What is the best white move here (6th)?

<17:56:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}White best move here is G9, to take 3x3 point is the best defence, and white separate black stones!

<17:56:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Black plays here at g10, that is important point, so need to take it.
<17:57:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Critical moment. Where does white defend?
If white defends at K10, that is risky, but white has good winning chanches. Agree?

<18:03:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Very nice move! Controls left side black material, and this move has attacking meaning.
This move was introduced last year by Klimantchev on PBM server.
