<16:45:27>[EMOTE]{over} says hi to everybody
<16:45:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}once I want to advice to change to sakata rule in 2nd tournament
<16:46:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}finally I give up the idea
<16:46:22>[TALK]{luwenzhe}maybe next time
<16:46:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe we need more discussion before that
<16:46:35>[TALK]{sunrain}o.a little pitty
<16:46:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe some of the members not familar with the sakata rule
<16:47:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}how many of you played under sakata before?
<16:47:20>[TALK]{Andry}me
<16:47:29>[TALK]{SamSite}some quick games only

<16:47:40>[TALK]{virag}very seldom
<16:47:43>[TALK]{whywhy}no
<16:47:44>[TALK]{killer21st}me,but seems hard in real games.
<16:47:48>[TALK]{Guest816}i've no idea of that

<16:48:02>[TALK]{shuwang}no
<16:48:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}do you think it is an good idea to take sakata rule in next tournament?
<16:48:19>[TALK]{killer21st}no research,no tactics
<16:48:29>[TALK]{sunrain}y,y,y
<16:48:31>[TALK]{AUTHOR}no

<16:48:45>[TALK]{casar}no
<16:48:55>[TALK]{casar}rif...
<16:48:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I know that some of you do deep ananlysis about the new rules
<16:48:59>[TALK]{virag}not yet
<16:49:20>[TALK]{killer21st}if we could study it in renjuclass  more than 10 lessons,maybe better.
<16:49:35>[TALK]{Guest804}sakata= no  .good
<16:49:37>[TALK]{whywhy}new department =)  ?
<16:49:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe some of who say "no" explain a little more?
<16:50:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}why do you think of sakata, author?
<16:50:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what*
<16:50:12>[TALK]{killer21st}i think,most of us dont know sakata clearly.
<16:50:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, killer21st, we do need to discuss more
<16:51:04>[TALK]{killer21st}if most of us dont know it clearly,what is the purpose of tourmament?just for fun?
<16:51:13>[TALK]{AUTHOR}You can see my article in renjukings forum
<16:51:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<16:51:20>[TALK]{smallpig}maybe  "two swap" better than sakata
<16:51:34>[TALK]{killer21st}if for fun,sakata is good:)
<16:51:48>[TALK]{sunrain}...
<16:51:49>[TALK]{Guest804}smallpig=goog
<16:51:50>[TALK]{virag}my idea is
<16:52:02>[TALK]{Guest804}=good
<16:52:02>[TALK]{virag}firsty playing offline tournament with sakata rule
<16:52:21>[TALK]{SamSite}if play by new rules , maybe should play 2 different tournaments: one for who have played before, and one for beginners
<16:52:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}good idea
<16:52:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I think,
<16:52:53>[TALK]{SamSite}then playing is more fun and equal
<16:53:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I suggest you all to play more in ORC
<16:53:35>[TALK]{virag}Samsite, it is hard to decide who was "beginner"
<16:53:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for fun, or for others purpose, or just try
<16:53:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}virag is correct
<16:53:56>[TALK]{SamSite}everyone could join which ever tournament he/she wants?
<16:54:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}play more, learn more
<16:54:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and turn to our topic
<16:54:43>[TALK]{whywhy}we need to get it popular first
<16:54:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<16:54:52>[TALK]{whywhy}i seldom see sakata game in ORC
<16:54:58>[TALK]{killer21st}yeah
<16:55:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}play in formal tournament is the best way to get it popular
<16:55:13>[TALK]{virag}my idea is, organise offline tournament by sakata rule giving more CP for winners, then it has more time to analyse and then we get more theory and game database
<16:55:20>[TALK]{Guest818}ou
<16:55:41>[TALK]{whywhy}then virag can get more CP =)
<16:55:46>[TALK]{killer21st}haha
<16:55:47>[TALK]{Guest810}.
<16:55:47>[TALK]{sunrain}hehe
<16:55:50>[TALK]{virag}:)))))))))
<16:56:01>[TALK]{whte}:)
<16:56:10>[TALK]{luwenzhe}whywhy, in the renlib files we published in games archive, you can search for SAKATA and find a lot of those games
<16:56:14>[TALK]{virag}then you got more theory :))))
<16:56:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}one question first, what's the difference between the time spent in games under sakata and under RIF
<16:56:42>[TALK]{virag}it is more crucial
<16:56:47>[TALK]{virag}the time
<16:57:03>[TALK]{SamSite}in sakata, more time is spent in early moves
<16:57:10>[TALK]{killer21st}yes,agree
<16:57:13>[TALK]{SamSite}not always, but perhaps most times
<16:57:15>[TALK]{luwenzhe}maybe need more time in opening phase for sakata
<16:57:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that means we need spend more time under sakata rule
<16:57:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}especially in opening phase as lu said
<16:57:55>[TALK]{SamSite}there should be some lessons on basic concepts of the rules first maybe before an official tournament
<16:58:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<16:58:19>[TALK]{Morden}agree
<16:58:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that's the reason we discuss it now
<16:58:25>[TALK]{SamSite}and perhaps on known "theories/tactics"
<16:58:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no conclusion, and discussion open for all of you
<16:58:54>[TALK]{killer21st}yes,that is 10 lessons what i said
<16:59:00>[TALK]{Morden}can we please start? =)
<16:59:17>[TALK]{Guest818}y
<16:59:21>[TALK]{Aurora}yes, when the class begin?
<16:59:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I think there will be no conclussion even after 100 lesson:)
<16:59:45>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Its already begun :)
<16:59:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the lesson begun

<17:01:56>[TALK]{SamSite}if cp's are given to best players, then rules should be equally fair to all :)

<17:04:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}do you think is it possible to organize the future tournament under sakata rule or others?
<17:05:16>[TALK]{luwenzhe}maybe, after some time of discussion and trainning
<17:05:22>[TALK]{Ando}you mean the renjuclass championships?
<17:05:29>[TALK]{Aurora}could we discuss it on forum?
<17:05:31>[TALK]{kaka}it's not easy to have a conclusion either :)
<17:05:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}online tournament
<17:06:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there are many discussion about renju rules in many kinds of ways
<17:06:21>[TALK]{Ando}sure, why not :)
<17:06:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I prefer we can play more under different rules
<17:07:14>[TALK]{Ando}sure, agree :)
<17:07:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}everyone can be equal before new rules
<17:07:44>[TALK]{Aurora}:)
<17:07:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so get ready for 3rd online tournament, maybe there will be big change:)
<17:08:07>[TALK]{Ando}:))
<17:08:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}about the renju rule
<17:08:28>[TALK]{sunrain}and maybe short game in 1/0(1):),
<17:08:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I found an article in RIF website
<17:08:32>[TALK]{luwenzhe}at least two months later, so enough time to prepare :)
<17:08:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, enough to practice
<17:08:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}http://www.renju.nu/r1rulhis.htm
<17:09:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is an article about the rules history
<17:09:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}interesting to read
<17:09:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and about the new rules
<17:09:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there are some:
<17:10:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}sakata, yamaguchi,

<17:10:30>[TALK]{AUTHOR}:(((
<17:10:39>[TALK]{Aurora}:)

<17:11:08>[TALK]{yun_shou}.
<17:11:23>[TALK]{dittp}.
<17:11:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what do you think the reason that we need new rules noadays?
<17:11:40>[TALK]{whywhy}more variants?
<17:11:55>[TALK]{SamSite}only few openings are considered "fully playable"
<17:11:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}do we really need?
<17:12:25>[TALK]{virag}need i think
<17:12:26>[TALK]{luwenzhe}for beginners, maybe not necessary. But for top players, too few variants to play
<17:12:47>[TALK]{whywhy}i dont need then
<17:13:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I found in past TWC
<17:13:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there are nearlly 110 games
<17:13:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and more than 80 games are d3, d11, d8
<17:13:49>[TALK]{AUTHOR}in online games,few variants. but in real games, not obviously
<17:13:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<17:14:01>[TALK]{Morden}found the rules of: "Renju with atomic bomb"  =)))))
<17:14:20>[TALK]{Morden}lets do that
<17:14:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I am not calling for new rules:) but I think we just need more choices
<17:14:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and enjoy renju more
<17:15:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we dont want to draw any conclusion about what's best rule
<17:16:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}especially in the lessons
<17:16:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and what's the purpose of proposing new rules?
<17:16:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}as some of you said
<17:16:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}more variants possible under new rules
<17:17:00>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HH

<17:17:34>[TALK]{whte}y
<17:17:37>[TALK]{kaka}y
<17:17:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}new rules give us more choices
<17:18:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and we can enjoy more from renju under new rules, espcially for beginners
<17:18:52>[TALK]{SamSite}changing rules is not problem-free either..
<17:19:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I want to say once more, the purpose of this lesson is not calling for new rules
<17:19:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we just learn to find more choices
<17:19:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it can be better
<17:19:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and also can be worse
<17:20:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}than current RIF rule
<17:20:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but do give us more choices
<17:20:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and we play renju not for champion only
<17:20:47>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yep
<17:21:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and now
<17:21:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I want you to discusse more about the tactics under sakata rule
<17:21:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}not for tournament
<17:22:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}just for the same purpose of past analyze lessons
<17:22:28>[TALK]{luwenzhe}that's good
<17:22:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that's one of the way we study renju
<17:23:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}SAKATA RULE 

First player puts 3 stones (from 26 openings, like with RIF standard rules). 

Second player adds 4th and 5th stones (white and black) wherever he/she likes. 

First player chose color (swapping or not). 

Continue as RIF standard rules (with forbidden moves rule for black).
<17:23:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that's the brief introduction of sakata rule
<17:23:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}do you think it is better for black or white?
<17:24:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or other words,
<17:24:12>[TALK]{AUTHOR}white
<17:24:13>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hard for tentative white, I think
<17:24:34>[TALK]{luwenzhe}if not prepared
<17:24:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what do you want to be, black or white, under such rule?
<17:24:43>[TALK]{killer21st}white
<17:24:45>[TALK]{luwenzhe}but maybe better for TW if well prepared
<17:24:53>[TALK]{kaka}w
<17:24:57>[TALK]{Guest816}the first player is better
<17:24:58>[TALK]{SamSite}equally hard, harder to know, what opponent has prepared
<17:25:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}any reason?
<17:25:12>[TALK]{AUTHOR}very large advantage for white
<17:25:20>[TALK]{killer21st}but,white could have detailed analyse about it.
<17:25:41>[TALK]{kaka}can prepare 4/5 before the game
<17:25:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what do you think of the advantage? compare with RIF rule?
<17:25:52>[TALK]{AUTHOR}becauce white can perepare a new 4-5th before a game
<17:26:23>[TALK]{killer21st}if one know nothing about the rule,maybe choosing white is bad.
<17:26:31>[TALK]{AUTHOR}There are so many 4-5ths in Sakata Rule, black can't perepare all
<17:26:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that's true
<17:26:50>[TALK]{yzhnie}hard to prepare
<17:26:54>[TALK]{AUTHOR}but white can perepare
<17:26:59>[TALK]{killer21st}yes.
<17:27:00>[TALK]{SamSite}do you think white can prepare good 4/5 to all 26 openings for one game ? :)
<17:27:01>[TALK]{kaka}just 26 opening
<17:27:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}another question,
<17:27:17>[TALK]{killer21st}yes,must!
<17:27:18>[TALK]{kaka}prepare 26 kinds are enough
<17:27:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}under RIF, what do you want to be, black or white?
<17:27:42>[TALK]{whte}.
<17:27:53>[TALK]{killer21st}if you wanna a good result,you should prepair all 26 openings:)
<17:27:58>[TALK]{SamSite}sounds little the 26 pairs of moves, but you need hundreds of moves of analyzing for each pair :)
<17:28:19>[TALK]{killer21st}RIF,white.
<17:28:25>[TALK]{whte}white
<17:28:35>[TALK]{sunrain}black
<17:28:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because white can prepare more?
<17:28:57>[TALK]{killer21st}but only for black puts first three stones.
<17:29:19>[TALK]{AUTHOR}because under RIF,white can choose the better side
<17:29:19>[TALK]{killer21st}no,because white could use swap.
<17:29:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, that's one of the key points
<17:30:02>[TALK]{AUTHOR}under RIF, all opening have much conclusion
<17:30:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and makes the sakata rule and RIF quite different
<17:30:17>[TALK]{AUTHOR}but under Sakata, it's hard
<17:30:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}II
<17:30:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe we need some example
<17:30:35>[TALK]{luwenzhe}but what do you think at then beginning of RIF rule, when most variants have no conclusion?
<17:30:37>[TALK]{killer21st}4 stones swap is quite different from 5 stones swap.
<17:31:04>[TALK]{killer21st}//804,use english
<17:31:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<17:31:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this opening is a good wxample
<17:31:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}example*
<17:31:32>[TALK]{yzhnie}..
<17:31:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}under RIF
<17:31:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}not playable
<17:31:54>[TALK]{yzhnie}..
<17:31:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because black sure win and white has the right to swap to be black
<17:32:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and under sakata
<17:32:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Second player adds 4th and 5th stones
<17:33:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JG
<17:33:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KG
<17:33:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}such as this positio
<17:33:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}position
<17:33:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}just example
<17:33:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for two top players
<17:33:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}both prepare well
<17:34:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which is better now? black or white?
<17:34:34>[TALK]{Guest804}BLACK
<17:34:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and the key point is,
<17:34:50>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Maybe after some time (short or long), all playable 4-5 pairs for sakata rule will be digged out :)
<17:35:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the first player has the right to swap now
<17:35:21>[TALK]{killer21st}but 4 and 5 are prepaired by white.
<17:35:21>[TALK]{Aurora}.
<17:35:45>[TALK]{AUTHOR}but he need time to think, and have little knowledge about this variant
<17:35:46>[TALK]{Aurora}..
<17:35:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, second player put 4th and 5th moves
<17:36:06>[TALK]{killer21st}if white had more analyze.he will win soon.
<17:36:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but can he make the position suitable for him?
<17:36:38>[TALK]{killer21st}amazing opponent is enough.
<17:37:08>[TALK]{killer21st}waste opponent 30mins and more
<17:37:18>[TALK]{whywhy}good strategy =)
<17:37:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}before a tournament, do you know what side will you be?
<17:37:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}lets guess
<17:37:39>[TALK]{whywhy}its easier for black to make mistake
<17:37:47>[TALK]{whywhy}without previous analysis
<17:37:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we are preparing for next WC
<17:38:02>[TALK]{killer21st}hmm
<17:38:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and the tournament will be played under sakata
<17:38:16>[TALK]{killer21st}i had an example,GM
<17:38:37>[TALK]{killer21st}could i use board?
<17:38:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and we have no idea of whether we play as black or white
<17:38:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}a moment
<17:38:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and when you are preparing
<17:39:09>[TALK]{whywhy}no matter which side we use, our opponent is more likely to make mistakes
<17:39:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}do you preparing for black or white?
<17:39:23>[TALK]{killer21st}white
<17:39:25>[TALK]{AUTHOR}for white
<17:39:30>[TALK]{bm}w
<17:39:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<17:39:34>[TALK]{killer21st}no use for black
<17:39:37>[TALK]{SamSite}but what if opponent has prepared your moves also ?
<17:39:46>[TALK]{luwenzhe}it only happens when people have little experience about sakata. when the rule has been popular for 100 years, for example, then who cay say which side is better?
<17:40:03>[TALK]{killer21st}also white
<17:40:09>[TALK]{whywhy}then we need new rule =)
<17:40:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}lu point out the key
<17:40:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so both players preparing for white
<17:40:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}as the example we saw
<17:40:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}on the board
<17:40:52>[TALK]{AUTHOR}ye, and who get the white side will have great advantage
<17:41:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the first play can preapre the 4th and 5th stones
<17:41:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the 2nd also prepare it
<17:41:51>[TALK]{yun_shou}.
<17:42:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the 4th and 5th can only be playable when it is a balanced position
<17:42:42>[TALK]{killer21st}balance position maybe more than 200 in this opening.
<17:42:44>[TALK]{AUTHOR}I don't think so
<17:42:57>[TALK]{killer21st}or more than 500
<17:42:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}discussion is open
<17:43:33>[TALK]{AUTHOR}If you don't know how to win under a "sure win" variant, it is not sure win for you
<17:43:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that's true also in RIF rule
<17:43:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes?
<17:44:00>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yep
<17:44:07>[TALK]{AUTHOR}so under sakata, not only balanced position can be play
<17:44:42>[TALK]{luwenzhe}same for RIF
<17:44:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and under RIF, also not only balanced position can be play
<17:44:45>[TALK]{SamSite}maybe there is a small difference, most sure win variants in RIF are known to be wins, so with usage of time it's easier to find the win than in not-so-known positions
<17:45:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but why so many games in d3, d8, d11
<17:45:29>[TALK]{luwenzhe}so I say the white advantage only exists when people have no much idea about that rule
<17:45:30>[TALK]{AUTHOR}Under RIF, we know the conclusion of almost all the opening
<17:45:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}how do we know the conclusion?
<17:46:06>[TALK]{luwenzhe}the same problem existed when RIF rule was first proposed :)
<17:46:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after games, tournaments, and so on
<17:46:14>[TALK]{AUTHOR}because under RIF, opening is not too many
<17:46:17>[TALK]{killer21st}no.no.no.
<17:46:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we are talking the rule itself
<17:46:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}just take away others facts
<17:46:53>[TALK]{AUTHOR}I think it's very very hard to research all the openings under sakata
<17:47:02>[TALK]{whywhy}true
<17:47:04>[TALK]{whywhy}too many
<17:47:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<17:47:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for both players
<17:47:30>[TALK]{luwenzhe}It just means we need long time to try. and it brings more fun during this period :)
<17:47:31>[TALK]{killer21st}we could imagine that if white could put 4-5-6-7 stone.it's much better for white
<17:47:47>[TALK]{luwenzhe}when we know the conclusion for all variants, then it means the rule dies again
<17:48:02>[TALK]{SamSite}in Sakata, finding out sure wins and advantage positions will take longer, because in RIF rules the game position is very limited up to 6 moves
<17:48:03>[TALK]{whywhy}even if we know, its impossible to remember all
<17:48:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the rule can  be survive only when it is equal to both side in the long run
<17:48:24>[TALK]{SamSite}in Sakata, only 3 moves are basically limited
<17:49:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Attention please, we are not proposing "better" rule now:)
<17:49:23>[TALK]{killer21st}do you think sakata will have a conclusion after 100 years?
<17:49:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe yes:)
<17:49:39>[TALK]{SamSite}my meaning was that sakata can be lasting
<17:49:39>[TALK]{kaka}if it will die again, what's the meaning to do research on it
<17:49:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe die, maybe as RIF rule now
<17:49:57>[TALK]{killer21st}no,always good for white
<17:50:24>[TALK]{killer21st}it is different!
<17:50:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so we can testing in future tournament:)
<17:50:49>[TALK]{SamSite}but RIF is better for white now than Sakata
<17:50:50>[TALK]{luwenzhe}why, killer, even if people know conclusion of all 4-5 pairs?
<17:50:59>[TALK]{sunrain}to think by ourself  from beginning of openings is a nice thing,y?
<17:51:03>[TALK]{killer21st}let me show on board
<17:51:06>[TALK]{luwenzhe}remember that black has the right to swap
<17:51:06>[TALK]{whywhy}i think we cant remember all
<17:51:11>[TALK]{AUTHOR}I agree with killer

<17:52:20>[TALK]{whywhy}just too much to memorize
<17:52:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and?
<17:52:42>[TALK]{luwenzhe}you just mean that it has a lot of variants. it takes longer to find out all conclusions
<17:52:43>[TALK]{killer21st}we know,if rif,forth is limited
<17:52:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, lu
<17:52:57>[TALK]{luwenzhe}but once the conclusion is known, then how could it be better for white?
<17:53:01>[TALK]{killer21st}but sakata,forth is open
<17:53:06>[TALK]{whywhy}then white always can surprise black with an unprepared opening
<17:53:35>[TALK]{killer21st}(255-3)*(255-4)
<17:53:39>[TALK]{SamSite}even if 4th is open, white can't always have advantage, because it would mean white would have to know everything himself :)
<17:53:54>[TALK]{AUTHOR}to remember 1000 variants or 10000 variants is quiet different for peaople
<17:54:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I see, killer21st. as lu said, you just mean that there are lots of varaints possible after the three stones
<17:54:08>[TALK]{killer21st}it maybe 62510,in these 4-5 pair,maybe 10000 is balance
<17:54:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but both players know that
<17:54:38>[TALK]{killer21st}so we will never have conclusion.
<17:54:41>[TALK]{whywhy}maybe i am wrong, i just think even if u know it is better for black or white, u cant remember the deep analysis
<17:54:55>[TALK]{whywhy}just as i cant remember the sure win for D4 / I7

<17:55:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}sure, we dont want to draw conclusion that black is better or white is better
<17:55:24>[TALK]{killer21st}so it is a joke to say that rif had no conclusion in its beginning.
<17:55:24>[TALK]{AUTHOR}even if we have conclusion, we can't remember them like RIF variants
<17:55:25>[TALK]{SamSite}if variant number is too big to remember for both, then neither color can have guaranteed advantage
<17:55:34>[TALK]{whywhy}yea
<17:55:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, the number of variants make harder to remember
<17:56:03>[TALK]{luwenzhe}if everything can be known and remembered, then what to play! :)
<17:56:11>[TALK]{HEX77}:)
<17:56:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}:)
<17:56:31>[TALK]{shuwang}the homework is more important
<17:56:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so what I want to say is sakata rule can be playable
<17:56:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for both sides
<17:57:08>[TALK]{sunrain}It can help us practise our imagination:)
<17:57:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}before the game,
<17:57:26>[TALK]{SamSite}one must remember, that in game position, so many more things matter a lot too than just type of rules and preparation
<17:57:29>[TALK]{AUTHOR}but white can remember 26 4-5ths before a certain game
<17:57:31>[TALK]{killer21st}yes,playable,but it is always better for white,it's my meaning.
<17:57:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we dont know whether we prepare more than the opponent
<17:58:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is simple to understand,
<17:58:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white can remember 26 4-5ths before a certain game
<17:58:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but before the game,
<17:58:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}you dont know who will be white
<17:58:53>[TALK]{AUTHOR}50%
<17:58:55>[TALK]{killer21st}:)
<17:58:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and both players prepare for white moves
<17:59:08>[TALK]{killer21st}you dont know who is lucky one
<17:59:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so both player can remember 26 4-5ths before a certain game
<17:59:20>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:)
<17:59:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and both players are equal now
<17:59:45>[TALK]{AUTHOR}but when the game began, the two players is not equal
<17:59:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that makes the sakata rule playable
<17:59:57>[TALK]{AUTHOR}for example
<17:59:58>[TALK]{killer21st}hmm.i dont think it's equal.
<18:00:04>[TALK]{AUTHOR}in GOMOKU rule
<18:00:12>[TALK]{whywhy}white can prepare for the variant, not just white
<18:00:26>[TALK]{AUTHOR}50% to be black ,is it equal for both players?
<18:00:38>[TALK]{killer21st}no
<18:00:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that's whu we dont play under Gomuku
<18:00:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}why*
<18:01:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is not comparable
<18:01:32>[TALK]{sunrain}may less two games between two plays:)?
<18:01:39>[TALK]{AUTHOR}a little comparable I think
<18:01:43>[TALK]{killer21st}yes,sunrain
<18:01:53>[TALK]{killer21st}i agree with your idea
<18:01:58>[TALK]{sunrain}:D
<18:02:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}renju rule is changing during the history
<18:02:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the purpose of changing,
<18:02:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is to make the game more equal
<18:02:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and more playable
<18:02:44>[TALK]{AUTHOR}ye
<18:02:59>[TALK]{AUTHOR}so we can try :)
<18:03:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}whether sakata can serve the purpose well
<18:03:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is not easy to say
<18:03:14>[TALK]{whywhy}time will tell
<18:03:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and needs to be tested
<18:03:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and let time tells us:)
<18:03:37>[TALK]{whywhy}=)
<18:03:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but if we dont play,
<18:03:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we will never know the answer
<18:03:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes?
<18:03:52>[TALK]{whywhy}yea
<18:03:54>[TALK]{AUTHOR}ye
<18:03:55>[TALK]{luwenzhe}under same conditions (most vairants have conclusions and remembered), sakata rule has  more variants to play then RIF
<18:03:59>[TALK]{kaka}y
<18:04:04>[TALK]{killer21st}if two great players,white will be better.
<18:04:18>[TALK]{virag}y
<18:04:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if two great players meet in the game
<18:04:25>[TALK]{SamSite}but in game situation, it doesn't always matter anything
<18:04:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}i think it is not the color decide the result
<18:05:15>[TALK]{whywhy}its likely to be one of the factors
<18:05:15>[TALK]{killer21st}but it is an important for result.
<18:05:34>[TALK]{luwenzhe}who knows somedays later people cant have better memory than nowdays :)
<18:05:36>[TALK]{whywhy}statistics of winning colour will tell
<18:05:37>[TALK]{killer21st}maybe they will play two games.
<18:05:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is the skill, strongness, and some other factors important for games under every rules
<18:06:09>[TALK]{SamSite}how much players have drunk last night and so on :))
<18:06:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the discussion will last long, I think
<18:06:35>[TALK]{shuwang}I think maybe there is a priciple that we don't know now  can calculate whether it is good for black or for white with the positon and the angle of the stone to the center
<18:06:38>[TALK]{whywhy}that sounds good, 2 games then all equal
<18:06:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and the best way to test is just to play more
<18:07:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}dont reject it in the first feeling
<18:07:34>[TALK]{whywhy}agree =)
<18:07:44>[TALK]{whywhy}just saying that we like to be white
<18:07:48>[TALK]{whywhy}more than b
<18:08:04>[TALK]{luwenzhe}action is better than talking? :)
<18:08:10>[TALK]{killer21st}two games....
<18:08:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in future lessons, I think we can discussion more about new rules, discuss more about the rule itself, not the players strong or not, prepare more or less
<18:09:05>[TALK]{whywhy}looking forward to that
<18:09:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}discuss more about the different tactics under different rules
<18:09:20>[TALK]{luwenzhe}good
<18:09:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}such as sakata rule,
<18:09:24>[TALK]{killer21st}good
<18:09:27>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<18:09:29>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<18:09:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we can discuss how to choose 4th and 5th move
<18:10:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in yamaguchi rule,
<18:10:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we can discuss how many 5th moves the first player need to propose
<18:10:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in each opeing
<18:10:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}opening8
<18:11:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}hope more discussion in ORC forum
<18:11:17>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:)
<18:11:27>[TALK]{whywhy}can the 5th move choices be the same?
<18:11:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}thank you for your discussion, especially those active speakers:)
