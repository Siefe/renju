<17:54:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we had advanced homework babout this variant before
<17:55:18>[TALK]{virag}ohh it was hard white win
<17:55:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the homework is to prove that if white win or not or it's a balanced position
<17:55:32>[TALK]{virag}i remember i tryed to find it
<17:55:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}can you show the win here, virag?
<17:55:48>[TALK]{virag}mumax find strong attack but not win
<17:56:19>[TALK]{virag}ohhh, it was hard, i cannot remember
<17:56:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if all the strong attack fail to win
<17:56:43>[TALK]{strul}:)
<17:57:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then who can say that such position is useless:)
<17:57:22>[TALK]{strul}good point gm

<17:58:41>[TALK]{strul}ok
<17:59:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this 21 is better in theory part
