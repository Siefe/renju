<13:27:23>[TALK]{AWP}RT
<13:27:23>[TALK]{killer21st}hello,xiaobaitu:)
<13:27:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Shortly speaking, to make 4x4 is less likely to happen in early stage of the game..
<13:27:28>[TALK]{AWP}i  am  sorry
<13:27:35>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Next time: "Trapping overline"? :)
<13:27:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}most 4x4 happens maybe after 50 moves.
<13:27:41>[TALK]{killer21st}ha
<13:27:44>[TALK]{renjunewbie}hi,xiaodaodao
<13:27:47>[TALK]{AWP}because  my  work
<13:27:52>[TALK]{killer21st}:-)
<13:27:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the reason is..
<13:28:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}3x3 takes less black stones to be set,
<13:28:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}therefore it is likely to happen in early stage,
<13:28:25>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<13:28:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}whereas 4x4 needs more black stones.
<13:28:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}second reason is,
<13:28:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we rarely make 3x3 after 50-60 moves, because the board is getting full,
<13:28:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and there are too many fake threes
<13:28:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and short lines
<13:29:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, when we consider the 3x3 as the main white weapon in early stages,
<13:29:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then 4x4 is a good weapon for ending phase of the game

<13:47:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}see how white fored the black stones
<13:47:24>[TALK]{killer21st}i did the same match in 263 game
<13:47:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, we can say, there are two kinds of 4x4:
<13:47:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}one kind is what just happens to come on the way
<13:47:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}being part of the VCT process
<13:47:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}like this one and last one
<13:48:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the second kind of 4x4 where we need to compose the black stones
<13:48:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is hard.
<13:48:16>[CLEAR]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:48:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is not easy to compose 4x4.
<13:48:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Because, it takes at least 8 black stones,
<13:48:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to be in perfect place, in perfect time,
<13:49:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and have the suitable white line attacking the 4x4 point
<13:49:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to have all this - nearly impossible task in creative play
<13:49:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}On the other hand, in real tournaments you play against real players.

<13:50:48>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:))
<13:50:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}common reasons of mistakes:
<13:50:56>[TALK]{8914643}ha~
<13:51:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the player is too nervous, because the game is important,
<13:51:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or opponent is strong,
<13:51:18>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yal
<13:51:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or the time is running out on clock
<13:51:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or the crowd is watching
<13:51:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}also pressure
<13:51:50>[TALK]{span}yeah
<13:51:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there are many reasons.
<13:51:59>[TALK]{8914643}50 percent win or lose
<13:52:11>[TALK]{eastmen}all of them
<13:52:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but those reasons make people make mistakes.
<13:52:13>[TALK]{span}i fear about watching people. :PPP
<13:52:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we may think, to create 4 black stones, and our own attacking white line may be hard,
<13:52:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but the reality shows that in real tournaments all is possible.
<13:52:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}since early years of my renju career,
<13:53:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i begab to experiment with long games,
<13:53:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}with constant pressure on opponent.
<13:53:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and while other games ended with draw after 100 moves, many of my games ended with 4x4

<13:53:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i dont think i am good or too creative or smart..
<13:54:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}actually the reason is different..
<13:54:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the reason the 4x4 succeeded was
<13:54:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the opponent usually does not believe there can be any danger amymore
<13:54:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}especially when nearly the whole board is full..
<13:54:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that makes him more careless...
<13:54:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}also, he may have a time-trouble,
<13:55:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which does not allow him think precisely.
<13:55:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In the future, we will have the whole lesson about the tactics of clocks

<14:16:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}almost unnoticable thing
<14:16:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but will offer some benefit for me in further 4x4 planning..
<14:17:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because, if k5 was not played,
<14:17:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it means, black could spare that four,
<14:17:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and later use it for defense,
<14:17:22>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<14:17:31>[TALK]{AWP}yes:)
<14:17:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}either k5 with timing, or to i7

<14:24:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and, it is quite likely, that both f3 point and c3 point would likely force black stone to f6 sooner or later,
<14:25:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so b6 will become more and more realistic trap
<14:25:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}my opponent was concerned about this trap...

<14:26:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is f4 point
<14:26:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but i knew he would never be trapped, if he had enough time to focus on defense..
<14:26:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so c3 move was another preparation move.
<14:27:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now he was afraid of overline..
<14:27:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}looks every obvious aim

<14:50:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you may wonder why did i need 38_88_20..
<14:50:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the reason is, i had to play f12 sooner or later,
<14:50:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to make the a7 trap work again
<14:51:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and i needed to have "something" there in upper area

<14:51:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if i did not have that line,
