<14:09:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}YKS, its not easy to say which is better.
<14:10:03>[TALK]{dongfujia}black is better?
<14:10:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The theory of 13-h10 is changing a lot these days.
<14:10:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Some months ago, the theory of h10 was considered so good for black,
<14:10:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then WC showed some good ways for white there,
<14:10:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and similar things happen with 13-j9,
<14:11:00>[TALK]{YKS}but you play h10.
<14:11:31>[TALK]{dongfujia}i believe black maybe better now
<14:11:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes good for black, sometimes good for white.
<14:11:46>[TALK]{ice}:)
<14:11:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Yes, I chose h10, for the good reason.
<14:11:59>[TALK]{oddgod}15 is the stongest?
<14:12:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}h10 gives more complicated variant than j9.
<14:12:08>[TALK]{dongfujia}15 is better
<14:12:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}j9 is often too peaceful.
<14:12:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And I had a good reason to believe,
<14:12:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that he will not play the best moves there.
<14:12:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In renju game, we dont need to play absolute best moves,
<14:12:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but relative best moves,

<14:18:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This was the game Purk-Chingin.
<14:18:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Just before that game, I had told Chingin about my game with Purk,
<14:18:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where I played 26-h5.
<14:18:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I mean, after 25-h7,
<14:19:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I told, that I had prepared such tactics with 4x4 control,
<14:19:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in case of such variant.
<14:19:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The stone 22, gives a chance to make a threat by move 30,
<14:20:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so the optimal black plan is to go to k9 without i12,
<14:20:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so that white will not get that threat at m10
<14:20:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?

<14:22:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This is how our game continued.
<14:22:44>[TALK]{YKS}you conclusion till 25th ??
<14:22:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The situation after 25th move is very complicated.
<14:23:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I think its quite equal position
<14:23:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}both black and white have chance here.
<14:23:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But if the player does not understand the deep ideas of this variant,
<14:23:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he may easily choose the wrong tactics.
<14:24:22>[TALK]{lkogr}can show wrong sample
<14:24:22>[TALK]{oddgod}such as what ?
<14:24:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Ok
<14:24:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In this situation seems that black has no attack.
<14:25:18>[TALK]{ice}y
<14:25:32>[TALK]{lq20008}y
<14:25:34>[TALK]{lkogr}y
<14:26:01>[TALK]{dongfujia}right
<14:26:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so some players would conclude,
<14:26:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if black doesnt attack, then white can attack.
<14:26:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But its a strategic mistake
<14:26:19>[TALK]{lq20008}what we should do now?
<14:26:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because white's position is not mature for attacking,
<14:26:41>[TALK]{yuelee00}y
<14:26:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}while black has a small advantage in most of areas of the board.
<14:26:53>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FI
<14:27:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He played such an active move.
<14:27:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Its very bad.
<14:27:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you know, whatever move on left upper side,
<14:27:20>[TALK]{dongfujia}why
<14:27:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black would respond to i12 or some other defense anyway,
<14:27:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and as a result, the f9 stone becomes a waste -
<14:28:00>[TALK]{dongfujia}yes

<14:29:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the line from 25 to bottow is open too
<14:29:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So you can see that stone 26 is so meaningless defemse,
<14:29:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}defense
<14:29:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and now, after these natural 27 and 29, white has to defend.

<14:39:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and same time, it let me realize that if the game would end with a draw,
<14:39:37>[TALK]{slappanu}maybe try to build in another area first to kill som activity
<14:39:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it would reduce my chances to first place.
<14:39:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes slappanu,
<14:39:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you are right
<14:39:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}thats what i did
<14:40:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Whenever you see that its not possible to win,
<14:40:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}dont try to cheat the opponent with some simple attack,
<14:40:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because if he does all right, then your position will get much worse.

<15:08:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he wanted the K5 point very much,
<15:08:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its very important for white.
<15:08:58>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KF
<15:09:01>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}ID
<15:09:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}After 26, I looked at the position,
<15:09:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I was so tired of all games, my mind was not bright,
<15:09:38>[TALK]{ice}:)
<15:09:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I started to count VCT at the top,
<15:09:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i go j12, ....
<15:09:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and he must j8,
<15:10:00>[TALK]{yuelee00}:)
<15:10:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then he has vcf,
<15:10:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then i go m8 and m7 to block it,
<15:10:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then if he stops it near, i win, if far, then.... who knows!
<15:10:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and i played it anyway!
<15:10:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}without making sure.
<15:10:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its not a good sign of a top player
<15:10:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but i was really tired by then.
<15:10:54>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JL
<15:10:56>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JH
<15:11:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}White has VCF now
<15:11:09>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}MH
<15:11:10>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}NI
<15:11:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}MG
<15:11:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I block it
<15:11:17>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}ME
<15:11:18>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LF
<15:11:19>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}MK
<15:11:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And he blocks it with only move.
<15:11:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and this is the situation, which was inevitable,
<15:11:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and it came.
<15:12:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}When I looked at the outcome, I felt regret for attacking so straight.
<15:12:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It would have been wiser to try softer 27 at the bottom, forcing him to defend,
<15:12:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then get another stone at bottom left,
<15:12:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}with decent black advantage for the rest of the game
<15:12:55>[TALK]{kawamura}Yes, 27-H4 is more natural.
<15:13:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But now, I realized, I did not only lose my win chance,
<15:13:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but also i lost the positional control.
<15:13:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So from that moment, I understood, I cannot win this game any more, and I might need to fight hard, to bring a draw.
<15:13:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Luckily i was not too crazy to continue attacking :P
<15:14:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I calmed down, and made a plan, how to use all power for defense.

<15:15:29>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}MJ
<15:15:31>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}MF
<15:15:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now I had stretched the upper side a bit.
<15:15:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It was necessary in order to catch 1 more tempo later.
<15:16:00>[TALK]{dongfujia}yes
<15:16:08>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LD

<15:16:14>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HG
<15:16:15>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FE
<15:16:16>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GD
<15:16:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He could not continue attack on the left side now.
<15:16:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Because whatever move he would make,
<15:16:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it does not give VCT,
<15:16:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so I could respond at the top,
<15:16:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and give him trouble by that.
<15:16:57>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HL
<15:17:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So he defended.
<15:17:17>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GM
<15:17:18>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EK
<15:17:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}52, excellent space move
<15:17:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sufficient enough as defense,
<15:17:35>[TALK]{dongfujia}nice
<15:17:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and extremely active for white self.

<15:17:59>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GL
<15:18:14>[TALK]{lkogr}..
<15:18:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but great 53 and 55 - they took the maximum of black's energy,
<15:18:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to break the inner power of whites.
<15:18:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In such static position,
<15:18:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}nobody wants to take g11 point.
<15:18:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Because whoever takes it, weakens his own position.
<15:19:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So the 55 was very wise.

<15:22:02>[TALK]{Fermat}ha
<15:22:03>[TALK]{ice}:)]
<15:22:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And draw for me would mean 2nd place.
<15:22:05>[TALK]{dongfujia}great people
<15:22:16>[TALK]{kawamura}like Okabe^^
<15:22:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is hard to win against the player who only wishes draw.
<15:22:23>[TALK]{dongfujia}haha
<15:22:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Haha
<15:22:32>[TALK]{ice}u
<15:22:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I knew he would open d11,
<15:22:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if I keep whites,
<15:22:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he would go into "long variant"
<15:22:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}with sure draw.
<15:22:51>[TALK]{dongfujia}will draw

<15:27:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Its funny for me,
<15:27:32>[TALK]{dongfujia}hehe
<15:27:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because a player who only focuses on memory archive, without looking on board,

<15:29:29>[TALK]{dongfujia}white is left an up
<15:29:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}With that game, I got the 8.5 points,
