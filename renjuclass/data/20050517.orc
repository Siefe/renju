<13:48:47>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KK
<13:48:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It is very simple, and very passive

<13:49:16>[TALK]{YKS}then, why?

<13:51:33>[TALK]{Renju_liu_t}E8
<13:52:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}What can do white now?
<13:52:34>[TALK]{Torsten}e8, e9 maybe
<13:52:40>[TALK]{verne}e8
<13:52:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Two possible way:
<13:52:47>[TALK]{YKS}e8 seems natural
<13:53:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}defending on the left because of black has a VCT threat in the left side
<13:53:28>[TALK]{Guest476}y
<13:53:35>[TALK]{verne}y
<13:53:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}VCT threat is: e9-f9e8-
<13:53:43>[TALK]{xiaolou}y
<13:54:14>[TALK]{Torsten}transfer still possible?
<13:54:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Another possible way: starting white attack in the right side using stone 36
<13:54:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Can you understand?
<13:55:05>[TALK]{verne}I choose defence :)
<13:55:16>[TALK]{endlessroad}y

<14:05:38>[TALK]{YKS}yes, but White can not win, right?

<14:14:52>[TALK]{Timo}y
<14:15:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So, in online game, it is enough to make some "medium strength" move to lose winning chance
