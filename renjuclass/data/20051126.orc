<13:41:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today's topic is "Jonsson's opening rule"
<13:41:19>[TALK]{slappanu}hi RT
<13:41:24>[TALK]{findfind}hi rt
<13:41:28>[TALK]{Yue}new rule?
<13:41:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Since ORC server does not have that rule,
<13:41:32>[TALK]{dongfujia}jonsson?
<13:41:37>[TALK]{tianxia}hi GM
<13:41:41>[TALK]{Guest204}.
<13:41:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}therefore many people do not know about it.
<13:41:47>[TALK]{Guest209}HI£¬GM
<13:41:48>[TALK]{Yue}I haven't heard that rule.
<13:41:49>[TALK]{dongfujia}yes
<13:41:59>[TALK]{dongfujia}the first time
<13:42:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you kow, RIF is searching for new opening rule,
<13:42:07>[TALK]{YKS}hope it is interesting
<13:42:11>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<13:42:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which could offer more playable variants,
<13:42:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and at the same time, the new rule should be as little change as possible from the old.
<13:42:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Jonsson's rule is one of the most suitable rules so far.
<13:43:12>[TALK]{YKS}interesting now.
<13:43:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Let me first show you the rule itself.
<13:43:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then we will discuss and analyse possible variants by that rule.
<13:43:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HH
<13:43:35>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}II
<13:43:39>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI
<13:43:43>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:43:46>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HF
<13:44:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}1 step: Player 1 sets an opening (just like RIF)
<13:44:17>[TALK]{Guest204}.
<13:44:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}2 step: player 2 may swap if he wants (just like RIF)
<13:44:32>[TALK]{dongfujia}like,:)
<13:44:38>[TALK]{xsir317}and the difference?
<13:44:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}step 3: white player will put the 4th move AND declares how many 5th will be offered in this game, 1,2 or 3.
<13:45:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}step 4: the black player has a right to swap now
<13:45:22>[TALK]{dongfujia}oh
<13:45:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}step 5: whoever is black after that, will put the named number of 5th moves on board.
<13:45:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Lets see by example
<13:45:55>[TALK]{dongfujia}ok
<13:46:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I am black,
<13:46:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I put i10 opening
<13:46:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now you can choose, swap or not?
<13:46:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}do you want to swap now?
<13:46:23>[TALK]{dongfujia}swap
<13:46:24>[TALK]{xsir317}if swap?
<13:46:33>[TALK]{Yue}swap.
<13:46:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok, you swapped
<13:46:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then i will get white stones
<13:46:37>[TALK]{xsir317}y
<13:46:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i will put the 4th now
<13:46:43>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<13:46:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and
<13:46:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}at the same time i announce
<13:46:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there will be three 5th moves in this game!
<13:47:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}(i chose 3 from 1,2,3 this time)
<13:47:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and now
<13:47:24>[TALK]{xsir317}now i want to play as white
<13:47:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you know there will be three 5th moves
<13:47:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and you can decide now, swap or not
<13:47:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you will be white?
<13:47:44>[TALK]{xsir317}y
<13:47:48>[TALK]{out}yes
<13:47:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok
<13:47:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now i take 3 black stones,
<13:48:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and place them to
<13:48:03>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GI
<13:48:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}g9

<13:48:07>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IG

<13:48:10>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:48:11>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI
<13:48:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and j9
<13:48:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which one do you choose?
<13:48:23>[TALK]{xsir317}and i choose one ?J9
<13:48:26>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:48:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok lets do so
<13:48:39>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI
<13:48:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and play your 6th then
<13:48:48>[TALK]{xsir317}and then ?just like RIF rule?
<13:48:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<13:48:59>[TALK]{dongfujia}i8?
<13:49:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}everything else is just like current RIF rule
<13:49:06>[TALK]{kawamura}like Yamaguchi rule
<13:49:18>[TALK]{xsir317}K8
<13:49:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, its similar to that
<13:49:47>[TALK]{kawamura}We are talking next rule will be like this after Yamaguchi rule in Japan.
<13:50:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this rule gives many playable variants,
<13:50:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and its very little change from RIF rule
<13:50:15>[TALK]{xsir317}yamaguchi rule can make even ten  5th rule
<13:50:22>[TALK]{kawamura}However, is it same ist player put until 4th move?
<13:50:25>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<13:50:26>[TALK]{xsir317}5th move
<13:50:32>[TALK]{kawamura}1st
<13:50:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}first player puts opening, same as RIF
<13:50:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}2nd player swaps or puts 4
<13:50:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}same as RIF
<13:50:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then the small difference
<13:51:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white player says how many 5th
<13:51:06>[TALK]{slappanu}most important different between jonsson and yamaguchi is when the number of 5th stones is the decided
<13:51:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then another can swap
<13:51:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<13:51:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the jonsson rule gives both players a chance to prepare
<13:51:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yamaguchi rule gives advantage to the opener
<13:52:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because in Yamaguchi rule SAME player decides both opening and 5th moves number
<13:52:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so he can have a big preparation
<13:52:18>[TALK]{kawamura}We think most important is not complicated for the begginers.
<13:52:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<13:52:41>[TALK]{dongfujia}i believe it is easy
<13:52:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Jonsson rule is as simple as yamaguchi rule from the learning point
<13:52:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but its much fairer to players too
<13:53:03>[TALK]{dongfujia}now
<13:53:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because one player can prepare opening,
<13:53:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and another player can balance by  playing his "own" 4th
<13:53:22>[TALK]{Guest204}.
<13:53:27>[TALK]{dongfujia}class may begin
<13:53:34>[TALK]{kawamura}I think this rule is more fair, I am sure.
<13:53:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And now,
<13:53:55>[TALK]{dongfujia}ok, agree with u
<13:54:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}let us all analyse it

<13:54:39>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<13:54:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}lets see if by Jonsson rule, we get playable variants
<13:54:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which 4th move do you suggest?

<14:06:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the 4-i8 may be strong resistance by RIF rule,

<14:07:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how about some other 4th, which were considered very poor by RIF rule,

<15:11:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}To conclude our todays lesson:
<15:12:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}We saw the ideas of Jonsson's rule.
<15:12:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The change from RIF is small,
<15:12:15>[TALK]{ice}y
<15:12:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and we get many playable variants,
<15:12:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}most of which already exist in our theory books
<15:12:25>[TALK]{xsir317}y
<15:12:37>[TALK]{ice}y
<15:12:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so it even doesnt gives the trouble of re-writing books toomuch
<15:12:51>[TALK]{skywalker}shift bit by bit
<15:12:52>[TALK]{YKS}just add 3rd 5th move
<15:13:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what do you mean?
<15:13:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you mean add 3rd 5th move to RIF rule?
<15:13:22>[TALK]{YKS}for the Book.
<15:13:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in fact,
<15:13:31>[TALK]{xsir317}maybe a good idea
<15:13:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}most of the books already have more than 2 5th moves
<15:14:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}My idea today was not to persuade about the Jonsson rule,
<15:14:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but to let you all think about possible opening rules
<15:14:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if anyone of you has a new idea,
<15:14:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}please send it to me before December 31,
<15:14:39>[TALK]{Guest204}.
<15:14:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and your proposal will be added to rules list
<15:14:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}from which RIF will choose the new rule
<15:15:07>[TALK]{dongfujia}ok
<15:15:19>[TALK]{xsir317}named as"xsir317 rule"?
<15:15:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}remember, everybody should make effort in their heart,
<15:15:30>[TALK]{xsir317}:)
<15:15:35>[TALK]{dongfujia}of course
<15:15:37>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<15:15:40>[TALK]{Yue}yes
<15:15:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the name doesnt matter.. in fact we prefer names that are not related to the author
<15:15:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because...
<15:15:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}those who do not make effort today,
<15:15:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}have no right to complain later
<15:16:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if he doesnt like the outcome
<15:16:04>[TALK]{dongfujia}haha

<15:16:14>[TALK]{skywalker}agree
<15:16:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, let us all make effort and think...
<15:16:32>[TALK]{dongfujia}agree
<15:16:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe there are better ideas than Jonsson and Yamaguchi rule
<15:16:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it all depends on you, guys
<15:16:47>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<15:16:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The deadline is December 31

<15:17:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}remember princples:
<15:17:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the new rule should be as small change as possible,
<15:17:12>[TALK]{YKS}how may rules has been proposed already?
<15:17:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}easy for beginners,
<15:17:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and give more playable variants
<15:17:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we have about 7 rules now
