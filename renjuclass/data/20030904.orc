<13:38:28>[TALK]{yyfcsd}round 3
<13:38:28>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IG
<13:38:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}First 10 moves are very typical.
<13:38:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This is the main theory of d11 nowadays.
<13:39:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Move 11-i11 has become more popular recently,
<13:39:04>[TALK]{Guest358}yes
<13:39:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and so it was also played in this WC.
<13:39:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IK
<13:39:31>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hard
<13:39:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It was hard for me to predict who would win in the game - Andersson or Karlsson,
<13:39:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but usually, white gets the better position here,
<13:40:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the white's win chances are better.
<13:40:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Who thinks black wins here more than whites?
<13:40:21>[TALK]{nick_hopper}tunnet )))
<13:40:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes, your opinion may be different from mine
<13:40:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Tunnet would play 11-i8
<13:40:50>[TALK]{claire}always hard to tell for me
<13:41:16>[TALK]{luwenzhe}he played a lot 11-i11 in email games

<13:42:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I once had a game where I was white,

<13:42:23>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JG
<13:42:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I won here by this 14

<13:47:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}These 17 moves are kind of theory here
<13:48:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}usually, white goes K8 here
<13:48:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KH
<13:48:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the result is white advantage in peaceful style
<13:48:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}has anyone of you played this 18th move before?

<13:49:11>[TALK]{nick_hopper}no

<13:50:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}both attack and defend same time
<13:51:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and what is the final outcome..
<13:51:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}well, that is what we will see now
<13:51:18>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HG
<13:51:29>[TALK]{nick_hopper}somebody make a mistake and opponents win

<13:51:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}well, in this variant, the problem lies much deeper
<13:52:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you will see the game, and i ask you , where was mistake
<13:52:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe none of you is able to tell just now
<13:52:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}let's see.

<13:52:30>[TALK]{smallpig}J7

<13:53:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in this game, its is very very hard to tell,
<13:53:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where was mistake
<13:53:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black has to be active, to keep tempo

<13:54:16>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ

<13:54:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the interesting part of this variant is,
<13:54:53>[TALK]{claire}interesting
<13:54:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black seems to be able to block the cut from both ends
<13:54:59>[TALK]{leto}also w has a three
<13:55:04>[TALK]{hobbang}haha
<13:55:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is L11 and g6
<13:55:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which would make the L8 real 4x3 again
<13:55:37>[TALK]{luwenzhe}interesting
<13:55:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but there is a question of timing.. while black blocks to g6, white will have enough time to take j10
<13:55:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so there is no 4x3 at L8

<13:58:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The first person who was really interested in the real problem here was russian player Salnikov
<13:58:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he talked to me on ICQ (about a year ago maybe),
<13:58:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and we discussed the dangers of this variant.

<14:10:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Although it is allowed to use analyse board,
<14:10:55>[TALK]{virag}need eye for VCF
<14:11:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i suggest, when we check VCFs,
<14:11:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}try to use brain
<14:11:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its a good training for you
<14:11:10>[TALK]{shaoping}wow
<14:11:13>[TALK]{Morden}k
<14:11:17>[TALK]{Guest357}ok sir
<14:11:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i will slow down here
<14:11:19>[TALK]{leto}k
<14:11:23>[TALK]{hobbang}I have no brain.. =(
<14:11:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and give you some time to look
<14:11:41>[TALK]{Guest357}i always use my eyes :)
<14:11:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is not hard in one reason:
<14:12:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the first moves of attack are very obvious
<14:12:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because other ways get stuck immediately
<14:12:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we all know i8 will be
<14:12:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and k6
<14:12:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and L5
<14:12:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and h5
<14:12:29>[TALK]{Guest357}i use Ando 's Visualisation
<14:12:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and i5
<14:12:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now that you know these moves
<14:12:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and this is the only interesting branch
<14:13:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then just focus on the nearby moves now
<14:13:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}see blacks clearly first
<14:13:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}h5 and i5 is black
<14:13:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}k6 and L5 are black too
<14:13:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}forget about the black at i8 and white at L8
<14:13:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}those become relevant
<14:14:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so justy look at the 4 black stones now
<14:14:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}h5,i5,k6,L5
<14:14:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you know where the white stones are
<14:14:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}after the black stones are fixed in your mind
<14:14:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}review the whites
<14:14:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}k7
<14:15:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it takes effort to remember k7
<14:15:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so we just keep in mind that k6_k5 is a "closed" pair
<14:15:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then we can skip k7 from brain
<14:15:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so we no longer need 7th line
<14:16:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and we can drop 6th line too
<14:16:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you just remember that k6_k5 is closed pair of blacks
<14:16:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok?
<14:16:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now lets just look at the 5th line and lower
<14:16:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if you BEGIN vcf search from here now,
<14:16:44>[EMOTE]{Volodymyr} says hi to everybody
<14:16:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you will realize its so easy
<14:16:50>[TALK]{claire}hello

<14:17:20>[TALK]{hobbang}ok
<14:17:21>[TALK]{leto}I am just third tis time(:

<14:17:47>[TALK]{leto}fourth(:
<14:17:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}also L5
<14:17:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we see black next four can be...
<14:18:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}k3
<14:18:11>[TALK]{luwenzhe}To find the four is not very very hard, but the cut is difficult to to noticed
<14:18:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is the only way to have any continuation
<14:18:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white stops
<14:18:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}from j4
<14:18:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now white has j4_j5_j6 line
<14:18:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it will become a cut line soon
<14:18:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black will play a four to k2
<14:19:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the plan is to connect k2 with h5 and g6
<14:19:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but when black plays i4 next,
<14:19:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then cut appears
<14:19:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}at j3

<14:40:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}from this example,

<14:40:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what to look for
<14:40:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}when seeking for vcf
<14:40:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}some people dont put the picture together,
<14:40:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}for example:
<14:40:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they see the f6
<14:40:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and h2 h4,
<14:40:57>[TALK]{Alan}also cut
<14:41:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but then they see, oh, there is cut
<14:41:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but then they think,
<14:41:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i can kil the cut with f7 and f7
<14:41:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and indeed, the cut is dead
<14:41:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but while thinking that,
<14:41:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they do not notice it will become 4x4 later
<14:41:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its a "black spot" of thinking
<14:41:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and many many players have it
<14:41:54>[TALK]{claire}it's getting really complicated ..... my brain is totally occupied !!  :(((
<14:41:56>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yeah

<14:42:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}our main VCF
<14:42:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then focus on the cut problem,

<14:42:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but while working with this two items,
<14:42:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we cannot put the whole picture together
<14:42:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and often find that we were wrong when its too late
<14:43:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is why its useful to train more often
<14:43:18>[TALK]{Morden}I will be dreaming about VCFs tonight.. =)

<14:52:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}2. there is another 20 which doesnt lose

<14:52:51>[TALK]{Alan}y
<14:52:51>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y

<14:58:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, if al 20th moves lose..
<14:59:03>[TALK]{Guest357}88 RenjuTearcher, thanks very much
<14:59:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then it will all depend on 32 now,
<14:59:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}whether 18 is playable or not
<14:59:27>[TALK]{Alan}yeah
<14:59:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if 32 wins, then the variant is good for white,
<14:59:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if not,
<14:59:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then white has to change 18
<14:59:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
